# catbook

A very simple docx file builder.

Catbook takes a CSV list of text files and assembles them into a Word doc. The doc may have up to three levels. The levels are titled using Word styles. There are a very small number of markups to do things like italicize quotes, force a page break between sections, etc. Markup chars and fonts are minimally customizable using .ini files.

See main.py and/or test/test_builder.py for usage.

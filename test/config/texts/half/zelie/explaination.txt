So it was that Zélie found her way to Besançon.

She spent her first months at University running back and forth across |Pont Battant| between the buildings of maths, physics, and the |Laboratoire de Chronométrie|. She learned the physics of pocket watch movements. And she repaired increasingly tiny and complex systems of gears, springs, and balances. Satisfying but somewhat rote work that didn't make obvious why she had been granted a generous work fellowship. The days were long. The winter, cold. There were endless books and tools and tests.

Besançon was full of secrets. People didn't answer her questions. No one admitted to knowing the name "de Saulcy". She wrote letters to Mile. He wrote back seldom. She hitched a ride to Dole to visit Lebre Carpentier. His wife made tea. Lebre's faculties were fading fast. She left no wiser.

After a few months, her advisor had encouraged her to apply for a position in the Time Lab at the Observatory. From junior |Apprentissage Horloger|, it was not a big jump to |Assistant du Chronographe| in the Chronometry Service under Aubert Malvoyant. It meant a three-kilometer ride over the river to the hills. The additional francs were welcome and the work was easy. She joked she was a nursemaid attending to the regularity of old man time.

Soon, though, Zélie became less enamored. She worked from two to eight p.m. four days a week. The basement of the Chronography Service's main building was cold. Though easy work, the workplace was dark and dull. Zélie felt it was also damp, even though she knew it could not be. The Time Lab was strictly climate controlled. Missed meals were a challenge. The uphill ride was hard. The night ride home seemed longer. She quickly began losing track of the days.

Her young manager in the new job had no such reservations. Aubert was excited to have his new staff member. He trained her himself and made sure his shifts overlapped hers. When they worked together, which was often, she felt him watching her.

Testing the isochronism of chronometers for the |Bulletin Chronometrique| did not require nearly so much of Aubert's attention. He was in the early stages of a crush. So far it wasn't going his way. That didn't stop him from trying. Spring was starting to bloom. He felt sure Zélie would come around, given time.

Aubert had a lot to learn.

"
"Tempora Mutatori.

He breathed the name dramatically. Zélie felt she was overdue to be amused. Attributing drama to Aubert’s otherwise uninspired self was worth a try. They had had hours of positioning watches, taking readings, stacking the ovens, and adjusting magnetic fields. Time dragged. She thought she heard a drip. Aubert was standing too close. She smelled a hint of mothballs, she thought.

"In 1880 a young horloger named Auguste Hrique came to the valley. Besançon was a center of watchmaking. The Observatory was new.

Aubert lectured unintentionally. Four years at a research organization attached to a university does that.

"Auguste's family was Belgian. Apparently, the guy was smart.

Zélie wondered about smart Belgians. She also wondered why Aubert spoke in a low voice. She imagined kicking him in the shin to see how he would react.

"Auguste is my boss', um, grandfather. Anyway. So, Louis Jules Gruey. You've heard of him, yes? He was the first Directeur of the Observatory.

Zélie knew the name.

"Gruey was an impractical dreamer. He convinced le Comité de Promotion Industrielle to fund two overseas junkets. He visited leading astrohorological institutes, fabricateurs, and top métrologues. Three continents, good hotels, big dinners.

Big dinners was a distracting thought to both of them. Aubert pushed on.

"He was researching time labs. Gruey had a secondary goal, though. He also spied on their astrometric instrumentation, dry plate astrographs, reflector and refractor designs, as well as the means to fabricate them.

Zélie thought that sounded right. Had she been Gruey, she too would have scavenged, compiled, and spied, just so.

"Now, during those trips, something happened to him. It isn’t clear exactly what.

Zélie worked too carelessly. She dropped a chronometer in a test tray roughly. Aubert frowned.

"There was stress. He was bootstrapping a national observatory in a provincial town. But it was more than that. Something broke him.

Aubert slowed to look up at Zélie. Was she following him? Emitting the right signals. He wasn’t sure. Zélie was pondering who had told Aubert his story was fascinating.

"They said Gruey returned looking like he had been locked in a room with zombies.

Zombies were more interesting. Zélie tried to focus.

"Gruey's first attempt at the observatory's architecture failed. There was incompetence in the committees, contractors, and boards. So very Besançon, n'est ce pas?

Aubert was trying for laconic townie, trash-talking his people as only a townie is permitted. Zélie wondered, why bother?

"The watchmakers didn't get along with the astronomers here. They still don't. What else is new, right? So, there were many heavy dinners of bickering. Intense politics. Typical Parliament of Besançon crap.

Zélie's pace increased. Was he losing her attention?

"Anyway. People were nonplussed by Gruey's decision-making.

Zélie found that she had a last piece of chewing gum in her pocket. She suddenly stopped. Made a point of rapt attention as she unwrapped it.

"They took extraordinary pains in the manufacture of the meridian telescope. That made sense. It is the core of chronometrics.

Aubert gestured vaguely around them.

"However, there were other things.

He stopped working altogether. Turned towards Zélie. He ticked his finger.

"He completely rearchitected the buildings from scratch. Separated the méridienne from the equatorial.

Another finger.

"Built the Chronometry building almost two hundred meters from the méridienne. You need a telegraph just to set our regulator upstairs!

Yet another finger.

"He sheathed each building in layers of cement, copper, and lead. He said there might be interference. As if chronometers could ever disturb the heavens!

Again gesturing around the lab.

"Then they dug to bedrock thirty meters below. Both la Pavillon de la Lunette Méridienne and la Pavillon de L'Équatorial Coudé. Thirty meters. Think of it! And the coudé itself. It was an exorbitantly expensive telescope for Besançon.

Aubert had given up on fingers.

"In the entire world, only a single Parisian instrument maker could make it. And they built it in a provincial field. At a small observatory built for industry, not cosmic insights. And at astronomical expense. For the benefit of exactly one astronomer: Gruey.

Aubert was on a roll. Zélie pulled him up.

"Only eight meters.

Aubert stopped.

"What?

Zélie's head cocked at the angle of superior facts.

"You said the foundations of the telescopes were thirty meters below ground. That's crazy talk. It was eight meters. The plaque at the entrance says so.

Aubert looked like he was attempting condescension. But mostly he just seemed anxious to be believed. So it is ever with conspiratorially minded boys.

"I'm sure it does. Even eight would be a lot. The reality is that those buildings run deeper than the arch of l'Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile. It was hushed up. Who knows how deep they are? The question is, why? What's down there? What's the point?

Zélie wondered that last too. She suspected she would be asked for something after this barrage of self-important storytelling. She was betting on dinner. The answer would probably be no.

"There is said to be a passage between the equatorial and the meridian. I have heard it called la Crypte aux Étoiles. If it exists, it might explain a lot. Have you heard of it? Has anyone mentioned it?

Zélie suddenly felt Aubert was interrogating her. And he sounded like a crackpot. She was suddenly tired of it.

"Nope. Nothing like that. Sorry. You work here full-time. Don't you know?

Aubert wanted her to know how much he knew.

"I have keys to it all. The buildings. Benches, drawers. Don't repeat it, but I may be the only one with master keys to everything. I can probably get into more stuff than even the Director.

He stopped boasting to frown.

"And yet, there is one door I cannot open. It is in the deep basement below the meridian circle. At the back of a closet full of ancient junk. The door is steel. The hinges are inside. Locked from within.

Zélie opened her mouth but Aubert continued in a rush.

"How can that be? I thought maybe it was some kind of safe. But how would you get in? Then I hammered on it. Looks like others have too. You can see the marks. It echoed.

Zélie leaned a bit back.

"Hmm. Well, you’re losing me.

She was done with her tray and ready to move on.

"Anyway, what does it have to do with that Auguste guy? Whatshisname? And Tempora Mutatori? I'm lost.

Aubert realized he had buried the headline and rambled. He was losing her. He rallied. Dinner hung in the balance! He upped the intensity.

"It has everything to do with them! The story gets better. First, I have to tell you about the murder of Louis Jules Gruey.

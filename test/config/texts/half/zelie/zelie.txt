>1946 - 1951 - Zélie grows up at Reims-Gueux, France

After the time of Louis Gruey came another time of wars. In due course, war receded. Rebuilding began. Peacetime diversions were again needed. Not far up the road from Besançon, the Grand Prix came again to Reims-Gueux. By then the artisans of Besançon were in decline; nevertheless, there was no shortage of interest in time.

The cars turned the French countryside upside down. A mess of hot people and hot peanuts and the roar of open-wheel single-seaters testing the melting point of Michelins. Near the road track's finish line was the two-story cement Chronometrage Pavilion. It was dressed in the yellow and white of |La Société Pétrolière Shell|. Men rushed about. Papers blew. Crowding and cold coffee. The slap of commercial signage and the smoke of Syrian cigarettes.

Each summer the Pavilion's lower floor shutters were folded back. The upper floor windows were thrown open. The tumult was unstoppable. At ten a.m. stopwatches lined the windows. Some of the observers could pick out the throb of their team's tuned exhaust before the manufacturers' colors separated. A young girl, Zélie, was one of those. Her mother longed for her daughter to matriculate at Catholic University, far from the track. Zélie wished only for more of the oil, tools, and temperatures that make hard metal objects move really, really fast.

Zélie Emmanuelle Barraqué tagged along with then unpaid staff of the reconstituted |Société Anonyme du Circuit de Reims| and its raceway in 1945. To her papa, Alfred Barraqué, the idea of Zélie following him around the newly reopened track had sounded adorable. He quickly regretted the absence of eyes in the back of his head. He feared the wrath of her mother, Danica Barraqué, should something untoward happen.

To solve this problem of his own creation, Al put Zélie to work making the timekeeping pavilion ship-shape. This put her under the sway of Émile Carpentier, known to all as Mille. Mille was the |Chronométreur en Chef|. Mille set her to washing windows. To his credit, he insisted on paying her a pittance. Eventually, they become inseparable, at least during the hot, noisy summers when time flew and hot metal screamed.

Danica did not know of this partnership for some time. It is perhaps good that she did not. Time was not Danica's friend. And Émile was the nephew of Lebre Carpentier. As we shall see, Lebre was part of the chain of events that led to Danica and Zélie living in Reims, not Besançon. Not with Jacques de Saulcy, a master of time and space, but with a glorified mechanic. Safe in a world where time moved not nearly so fast.

Zélie wouldn't come to know her real father's name for many years. It would take longer for her to learn he was already dead.

Émile Carpentier was called |Mille| by the drivers. Zélie called him Mister Mile. She did it with a terrible English accent. Much later, her English friends would take her accent as a caricature. It wasn't meant to be. She learned proper English words from BBC announcers. English attitude she learned from the motor pool. There, her father ended his war by enabling skirmishes between stripped-down Daimler Dingos and tricked-out Willys Jeeps. His horses always won; he played both sides. Zélie favored the Dingos. And she loved Mile.

Mile was as steeped in music as in |le chronométrage|. Keeping time being the common thread. Seemingly the whole Carpentier brood was musical, going back to Mile's grandfather, Jules Carpentier. Jules was an electrical inventor of musical machines. Zélie never had a chance to meet Jules. He died in an illegal street race years before she was born.

Mile, being the family's black sheep, didn't do more than whistle. As |Chronométreur en Chef|, he cut a high profile at the track. Because he did, his constant whistling of Debussy and Berlioz, all sharp flats and flat sharps, earned him some ribbing. Humor at his expense helped keep him human. That was important to his wide-eyed little servant Zélie.

By the time Zélie began to rival Mile's obsession with time, she was whistling Debussy too. Mile and Zélie were a good match. Their tics synchronized. Their side-eyes ganged up. They were temporally, mechanically, and musically not screwing around. If a team manager did not like how Zélie kept chart, he had the option of being summarily ejected from the Chronométrage Pavilion by Mile. Thuswise, the terrible two made it clear: at the track, |chronométrage| is the ruler of all things.

Oddly, despite her father being a local champion and well-known prototype designer, Zélie learned driving from Mile. It happened the third race she kept chart. A low-key Sunday. She and Mile were on a platform erected in front of the timing pavilion. Rough wood in cotton and craft paper. Cheap French flags. Eight pro teams. Fifteen cars.

Zélie's father was hot-seating a Gordini T prototype with Roger Laurent, a younger driver who had recently switched from motorcycles to cars. A fire-engine-red Alfa Romeo Alfetta dogged the cool-blue T for kilometers. On the thirteenth of twenty, the drivers changed positions once again. Abruptly, not two hundred yards from the timekeepers' platform, the Italian got his left front wheel tangled in the right rear of the Gordini.

The physics went elastic. Light blue aluminum scrunched down on its springs, then reared up on its rear axle. It made in an aggressive |tour en l'air|. Spun gracefully on its z-axis. Ended with a rapid |pirouette| over the hay bales, smashing through the inside fence and plowing up the shoulder.

Metal and loose tires rocketed down the track. The car's single mirror flashed as it arced towards the sun. Its bare axle bit the dirt and levered the Gordini end over end. Tires blew on jagged fragments. A second car collided with the Alfetta's flying wheel. It helicoptered dangerously down the pit lane.

Zélie screamed. Lap chart and pencils flew. She charged the rail. Without Mile grabbing her shoulders she would have jumped onto the course. Mile pulled her back. He spun her firmly a quarter turn clockwise.

"Wait! He is there. He's safe.

Alfred Barraqué was running pell-mell past the platform. Headed diagonally across the track. Dodging the last cars in the pack. Heavy fire blanket flapping under pumping arms. He slid on oil. Leaped over the hay and drainage. Scrambled up the embankment. Heavy smoke. The driver's helmet lolled at an alarming angle. There were shouts.

"Stay back. Let Al save the man's life. You stay with me.

The race was quickly called. Firefighting gear swarmed the track. Zélie was shaking. It was the first crash she had witnessed. And close! Had it been the cars' opposite wheels the crash might have slammed right into the platform. She had thought her father was driving. The thought took her breath away.

"Come with me. Let's get some air. We're no help here.

Mile herded Zélie off the course. Quick-marched her through the pits. Past the mechanic bays to the outfield lot where teams unloaded race cars. This was not Mile's first crash. He had an idea of what Zélie might be feeling. He thought he might do some good, at least to his way of thinking.

"It's probably time you learned to drive.

Zélie wasn't expecting that.

"What? Now? Drive what? To where?

She thought she was being shepherded away from the track as a delicate flower. Which goodness knew, she was not! Mile had another idea: she needed to get behind the wheel before learning if the driver survived. Before any chance the driver in her might be frightened out of her.

He knew. Miles had seen his grandfather's crash as a boy. He knew fearing life was but few steps beyond the fear of death. Zélie didn't need to have to do the work on herself that he had done. He grabbed the smallest helmet he saw. Steered Zélie into the weeds, trailers, and ranks of quiet cars. That day the girl would drive.

Too big helmet buckled. Too loose gloves snapped. Eyes still glazed.

"Al will always be there for you. He was there for Laurent today.

Mile had stopped referring to Alfred as her papa. She had noticed. Then they found a car. The car Mile picked seemingly at random was a gorgeous French-blue Gordini Biplace Sport Type-8X. No number in the white circle. No scuffs or marks. Shiny black rubber. Rust-red leather. Smoothly billowing quarter panels. Taped headlights.

Whistling, Mile swung his legs over the low doors and dropped into the passenger seat. Zélie perched on the driver-side door. Then carefully lowered herself.

"Whose car is this?

Mile looked away.

"It is yours, naturellement. You are at the wheel; therefore, it is you.

Mile smiled conspiratorially. Zélie's eyes were wide.

"You know how she starts?

Zélie pointed to the plunger and key.

"Yes, turn the key and then push this button.

Zélie looked at Mile. Mile looked back, amused.

"Well, do you have the key?

Mile did not have the key. No matter. He proceeded to show Zélie how to hot-wire a push-button starter. She already knew. Mile gestured impatiently.

"Drive!

Knowing the theory, she attempted the feat. It took four attempts to get the little car backed up and nose out. Zélie concentrated. They barely missed obstacles. His face was frozen. Her's, young.

Eventually, they did it. More clutch grinding. Forward! Ten times they circuited the large field. The gravel spit faster and louder. The wheel turned more and more easily. The brake bit less. The clutch quieted. By the fortieth turn, Zélie smiled and rammed through the gears, if not yet like a pro, at least not like a child. Soon after, they returned to where they started and gingerly parked.

Zélie's shoulders unknotted.

"Will Laurent be Ok?

Mile looked back.

"I don't know. I don't think it was his time. But what will be will be.

Laurent was a friend.

"Common kid. Whistle Clair de lune with me. Let's go see.

Mile gave the gift of not fearing by giving the gift of driving. It had been his car they stole. Zélie stole it several more times before she shook Reims off her shoes for good.

"
Mile's second gift was an idea. It too came from Mile, surely; though, not in one lump-sum. The precursor started years prior. Zélie's mom, Danica Barraqué, forced Zélie to take piano lessons. The lessons were taught by a young woman named Annie. Shortly after Zélie started, Annie took ill and was sent away to an aunt somewhere. Her replacement turned out to be Marie Carpentier, Mile's youngest sister. By the time Al Barraqué gifted his daughter's labor in service to the track's |Chronométreur en Chef|, Zélie had already been primed with enough Debussy to pass muster with Mile.

Zélie's fingers knew the stuttering argumentative inflections of Mile's beloved |Clair de lune|. As did Mile's. Non-practitioner though he was, Mile nevertheless owned a piano, after a fashion. He kept a black |Presentan| silent practice keyboard at his rickety desk on the second floor of the Chronometrage Pavilion. About the size a large artist's paint box. Inside, two octaves with the weight, damping, and travel of a real grand piano.

Miles would unfold the |Presentan| during races. He would play silent snatches of |La Suite Bergamasque|.

When the cars thundered down the straight. When wheels thumped the pit lane strips. When viscous tires scarfed on warning roughs. When half-burnt fuel flowed in so thick the hacks at the window coughed spasmodically. The syncopation of |Clair de lune| snapped into synchrony. It punctuated downshifts, blowouts, and the baffling of exhausted sheet metal. Debussy drafted the Doppler shift.

Zélie loved it. She whistled along to music only she and Mile heard.

"
The penultimate summer before college was the triumph of the Momentary Zélie Lap Timer. Ultimately only four timers were created for the first four lucky teams that asked. By the time she finished the fourth, Zélie wouldn't have constructed a fifth for all the Grand Prix-generated francs piled in the strongboxes of the Champagne vineyards of |Vallée de la Marne|. The Lap Timer was old. It was time for something new.

How had the new idea crept into her mind? Perhaps as she extracted the mainspring driving a music box's pin drum. Or maybe while laughing at the sad looks of the Press Box boys as they failed in their attempt to wire the broken ticker tape to the telegraph. Was it some artifact seen at |Dubois Artisans Électronique|? Most likely it was a half-heard story of Mile's grandfather's musical inventions told as Mile resolutely refused to help Zélie keep time. Regardless, one morning Zélie woke knowing: the key to the perfect lap chart was the key of C.

Zélie didn't usually touch Mile's stuff. Nobody did. Sometime after dinner, about seven p.m., she rode her bike back to the Pavilion. The sun was lowering behind the trees. At the raceway, several trucks were parked on the road near the stands. Workmen and ladders. Heavy cables snaking along the margin. A policeman was available to direct traffic. He was smoking with the work crew.

"What's going on?

Zélie yelled over the engines and tools. Henri, one of the club volunteers, yelled back.

"The power company to agreed to upgrade the wires. The club wants to do night races. You know, twenty-four hours races.

||La Société Anonyme du Circuit de Reims| was almost completely recovered from the war. The local economy was humming. Petrol was no longer rationed, nor so dear that races were controversial. The Circuit raised its sights. A |24-heures de Reims-Gueux| was the next step up.

"Le Mans here we come!

Zélie dropped her bike. Ran up the stairs up the left side of the Pavilion. Lights out, the power down. The sun projected through the empty top floor animating the grandstands across the road. Zélie had been thinking about it all day. She didn't like to wait. She also didn't like to ask for permission. A little waiting was preferable.

Now she stood in front of Mile's desk. A battered pine roll-top. Chipped varnish and carved initials. The right-hand side was scorched. The front had bubbled from the heat. The bottom drawer handle was missing. In place, a loop of electrical wire. Zélie yanked it open.

The silent piano's front half unfolded. It lay flat. The lip protruded to prop up sheet music. There were seventeen ivory keys. Slightly yellowed and subtly worn. Intermixed, twelve ebony keys. Twenty-nine total. That could work, she thought.

Zélie flipped the heavy box over. She felt the keys make slow soft clunks as they dropped. Brass screws. Phillips head. Mile kept tools in his desk. Jeweler's hammers to sheet metal punches. The screws loosened easily. She lifted the bottom off carefully. Inside the action was complex and well-balanced, to simulate the feel of a grand. Instead of strings, the hammerheads struck ridges glued to the case.

"This could work, absolument.

Zélie spoke aloud sometimes. When it was important.

"What do I need to make this work? That is the question!

Zélie had an idea. She hadn't worked out all the details. The basic idea was this: what if she had a piano keyboard where each key tracked the laps of a single car? She would conduct chart as if she were playing |Clair de lune| at |Opéra de Reims|. So far, so good. And really, given the state of the art, it was quite a clever idea.

"I could have a watch for each key, maybe?

The darkened desks and typewriters did not respond. They weren't convinced.

"Too expensive. Too many moving parts. How would it all fit?

The tangled blinds and pin-up calendars nodded in agreement.

"If a key could press the face of the watch into a paper and the hands were inked...

Several broken pencils and a cheap crystal receiver that might still have worked tittered. They were sure that had been a joke.

Zélie's face squinched up in concentration. The room got darker. Her brain was still in the process of lighting up, even as she peddled home. Nothing got done that night, including sleep. In the morning her cranial wiring was still sparking. Ticker tape! Back on the bike. Back to the grounds. This time, the Press Box.

The Box was empty. The broken ticker tape machine was in the closet, unguarded. Should she steal it? Probably not. But she did. And because she wasn't a hardened criminal, she left a note. Down three flights with the heavy contraption. Down the line past half the pits. A few early arrivals shouted hellos and wisecracks. Her forearms were shaking.

When Mile arrived a few hours later he found Zélie in the first-floor equipment room. She sat before a crude key made of scrap wood. It was taped to a windshield wiper arm that was nailed into a plank. The plank also supported a cardboard shoebox tipped on its side, also nailed down. A press on the key depressed the near side of the wiper and concomitantly raised the hammer side up to the roof of the shoebox. At each end of the shoebox, she had cut a five-centimeter slit. Through the slit, across the roof, above the hammer, she had run the ticker tape. The tape was clearly meant to spool up on the reel, rather than off it.

The feral inventrix had electrical tape around two bloody fingers. Grime on her face. A rip in one sleeve.

All this was instantly apparent to Mile. Mile was no slouch. Having barely entered the room, he was instantly out the door. Running upstairs to his desk. In seconds he was back, gasping, silent piano in his arms. He knew at once the prototype was |chronométrage|. It clearly had a key that interacted with a tape. He thought he saw where Zélie was going with this and he wanted in.

"Do you need keys? I have some.

Zélie looked uncharacteristically hesitant.

"Let me tell you what I'm thinking.

She showed how the wood key pressed into the top of the box.

"I think it would be best to use a needle. To make a hole in the tape.

Mile was curious. It would weaken the tape.

"Yes, but there might be something we could do in the future. Maybe electricity or light?

Mile pondered this.

"Anyway, when another car passes I press another key. It puts another hole in a different row of the tape.

Zélie used her fingers in the air to describe parallel tracks on the tape.

"How wide can we make the tape? What if we had thirty or forty or more cars?

Zélie thought the ticker tape would be enough.

"But we could use a wider tape, sure. Maybe like adding machine tape? Anyway, the hard part is getting a piano and modifying the keys. We'll need an electric motor. Some kind of punch tips. A bunch of stuff.

She rocked back on her haunches.

"But Mile, if we can do this we can make an exact record of the race. If the tape is at a constant speed we'll be able to get the timings without a stopwatch. A permanent record. Without writing anything down!

The unspoken matter was the silent piano. There it was. Battered. Worn keys. Without another word, Mile flipped it over, grabbed a screwdriver, and started disassembling the bottom. Zélie crowded in. They forgot their old plans for the day.

In the end, there were many gotchas to overcome. The tape would rip. When two cars came together the marks had to be appropriately spaced in two dimensions. What speed should the tape run at? Could they calibrate the seconds per centimeter? Once calibrated for a race, could they keep the motor constant? How would they annotate the tape with regular time registration marks? And especially, could they make the tape thread past the keys at a set speed, even as the size of the tape wrapped on the take-up reel grew, consequently pulling faster? So many small problems. One by one, they solved them.

They marked the laps with a special pen-tipped key. The tape ended up being nine centimeters wide. On that, up to thirty cars. A staggered line of drafting pens drew lanes between the punches. Each race required a large new roll of adding machine tape.

Solving for the changing speed of the pickup was hard. First, they tried to modify a motor to run at variable speeds. That attempt cost a week. Next, a capstan arm pushed in by another arm that was gradually pushed out by the thickness of wrapped tape. The idea was to change the path length as the take-up changed. Another week spent. Finally, Zélie moved the motor to the capstan and pinch roller assembly right at the end of the keys. A loose rubber band acted as a friction power belt between the capstan and the take-up reel. A weak tensioner spring with a roller kept the tape taught enough as the take up speed fluctuated.

It worked. Like the Momentary Zélie Lap Timer, it wasn't rocket science. And yet it was very effective.

When all was said and done, the drivers cheered, the team bosses celebrated her seventeenth birthday with a massive layer cake, and the press boys took credit for providing the ticker tape machine. Most importantly, the lap chart was never again controversial. Or, at least the tape was not. The shouters sometimes caught flak. Then too, the constant whistling of |Clair de lune| got some looks, some days.

"
Now, Zélie and Mile had become minor celebrities in Reims. Still, they wanted more.

"Mile, our system is good, oui?

Mile agreed, it was good.

"We want other tracks to use it too, right?

Mile agreed, they did.

"It needs a name. A good name. A good name and a logo and a banner.

Mile was in favor.

"And FIA should use it!

The |Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile| was the governing body. FIA ran the Grand Prix. They were the big time.

"Hmmm. Yes. Hard. But we can work on that.

The FIA President was one Jehan de Rohan-Chabot. Zélie wrote him.

|Our system is proven to track lap times with fewer timekeepers and with unprecedented accuracy. Using the Piste Zeléscripteur, a venue can eliminate lap chart disputes. The resulting tape provides a permanent lap time record.

There was no response to Zélie's letter. They tried other avenues. Could the subprefect of the arrondissement make inquiries? Miles was rebuffed. Other Grand Prix venues were contacted. The head of Automobile Club de Normand was interested. In the end, though, the perennially underfunded AC Normand was too occupied with bootstrapping Rouen-Les-Essarts to pay attention to experimental timekeeping techniques.

Zélie's final year of high school started. The raceway became quiet. Saturdays were still noisy in the pits, but there were increasingly fewer teams. Shorter races. The garage bays went quiet. No spectators in the brisk winds. Auto clubs never quite stop, and yet winter comes.

There came an evening when Zélie was doing sums on the second floor of the Chronométrage Pavilion. Knit gloves with cut fingers. It was dark. The glass rattled. Zélie and Mile had put away the so-called |Piste Zeléscripteur| weeks before. She was alone, she thought. Mile came up quietly.

"Ah, Zélie. School is teaching you how to subtract two numbers correctly. This is good! It's about time.

Zélie sensed that the hidden variable here was humor. Everything was always all about time. She declined to look up.

"Kid, common downstairs for a minute.

Zélie did look up. There had been something in Mile's timber. His eyes were wide and laughing in the reddish light of the desk lamp.

They made their way downstairs. Mile led to the storeroom. He paused at the door. Looked at her quietly.

"I have something for you.

Mile opened the door. A leaning floor lamp under race flags lit the room. It had been half emptied by pushing auto junk and race debris into walls of clutter. The center was empty. Except for the upright piano.

It was a tawny |Pleyel et Cie| cottage piano gleaming in the soft light. Quite out of place. Its bench stuck out perpendicularly. On the cabinet, an old throw under a rough wood platter. On that stood two wine glasses and a bottle.

The piano's fall was pulled back and yellowish ivory keys peeked out. However, most of the keyboard was covered in a solid-looking oak box sporting a thirty-five-centimeter wood-handled iron wheel. On the bass end of the piano, a stack of connected heavy paper cards. They unfolded into a tape that fed into the oak box. On the treble end, the tape emerged from the box and tumbled down into a neat stack.

This was Jules Carpentier's |Mélotrope Répétiteur|. The World's first recording piano system's playback component. Zélie understood what this instrument was just as quickly as Mile had recognized her single-key |Zeléscripteur| prototype months earlier. She ran to it. Tugged gently on the cards. Felt the holes with her fingers. Ran her hands over the oak. Carefully rolled the drop-forged wheel a fraction. Inside, a key pressed softly.

She felt a hand on her shoulder. She straightened. Looked back at Mile. He held out a large envelope to her.

"Your invention hasn't yet taken over the world. But I tried one last idea.

Zélie looked up at him, unsure. She reached out and took the letter. What was it? What was its connection to the mysterious music machine? She moved closer to the lamp. She opened the envelope. It was addressed to both of them. She began to read.

Behind her Mile sat on the |pianino| bench and began cranking the wheel. He turned it slowly and as evenly as he could. The tape advanced smoothly. It accordioned into the small pile. The keys played under the box. |Clair de lune|, of course.

|Dear M. Carpentier and Mlle Barraqué.
|Thank you for Zélie's application for the Apprentissage de la Chronométrie and the Young Watchmaker's Head Start Grant. Besançon University and the l'Institute de Chronométrie are exceedingly pleased to offer you the apprenticeship and award you a full one-year Head Start grant. Congratulations!

In the dim light, Mile was glowing. He turned the Mélotrope's wheel steadily. Zélie was rereading the short letter over and over. Later, there would be time for the other documents enclosed.

"How did you do it?

Mile smiled. Sure, his brother, Lebre, had connections. But Mile had done nothing more than tell Zélie's story.

"You did it, not me. You earned it, kid.

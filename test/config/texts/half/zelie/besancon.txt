The next day the warm glow Mile gifted Zélie was recycled into a smouldering visible at a distance. The Barraqué household woke in a mood. Its members stalked to their corners, retreating each into their own bents, biases, and fixations.

From a distance, anyone might miss the way Danica Barraqué shredded cigarettes. Where the habit came from no one could say. When? Also unknown. Surely since the war ended. Cigarettes had been too dear. Was it pathological? Probably. Regardless, it was disturbing. Once observed, irreversibly seen.

Danica's right thumb, fore, and ring fingers were permanently tanned. She loosened the paper with a long fingernail. A contemptuous undressing. She unzipped the delicate fold. Pulled the casing back. Exposed the moist tar.

If Danica obtained an American brand it was special. She slowed her breathing. Unraveled the foil slowly. Gently tamped and pressed. The scent! Americans were soft, long, and rich. They were a luxury. That, or the proceeds of begging.

More often, though, the cigarettes were not American. Instead, merely tar-dribbling near-eastern choke sticks. Illiterate immigrants to be dealt with roughly. Tearing into their innards commenced immediately. She delaminated leaves from the frail paper skin. Then commenced the crushing of the fibers.

An onychophage would have salivated.

A moment of crushing, rather than feeling crushed, was a rare pleasure. Well worth the constant stream of francs. She clenched her teeth. Dug deeper into her purse. The devastated |Rue Folle-peine|-bought weed pulled her inexorably towards quiet rabbit starvation.

"You should never have let Émile get his hooks into her.

She glared at her husband, Alfred Barraqué. Danica was a sharp corner on a regular Saturday morning. That morning had not been regular. Their only child, Zélie, had returned home late in great excitement. She bore a letter from Besançon University and an expression suggesting, at least mentally, she was already packed.

"I don't know why you let him! The Carpentiers aren't who I want Zel learning life from. What was I thinking letting her hang around the track? What were you thinking?!

Her wheels were gaining heat, losing traction. Alfred felt the conversation sliding. Danica steered about as well as a rear-engined jalopy with a spinet strapped to the boot. Her turning radius was wide. Al thought of himself as both test driver and the universal joint linking Danica's pitch and Zélie's attitude. It was a strain.

The sitting room paused. From the upstairs hall, Zélie couldn't hear anything. That didn't mean nothing was happening.

Al Barraqué was a straightforward man. An engineer and mechanic. He built cars that moved really fast. He was good at it. His cars were fast enough that people were eager to pay him. Al's prototypes turned heads, broke conventions, and won races.

His daughter did much the same. Add broke hearts and tempers to the list. Zélie was always his first thought. When the oversteer corrected, the wheels touched down, traction returned, the clutch slid home, and the smoke was safely behind him, his first thought was always his little Zélie. Zélie would have loved that turn!

He sighed. Drivers notice little things. They have to to survive. The swooshing harmonic of balding tread. The sticky tap of an oil leak. The clicking vibration of a chipped rack and pinion. At barely forty-eight, he noticed he was sighing more.

"I know you don't like Mille. I'm not suggesting that...

Danica made a noise, waved her hands, and turned away. A lace fold fluttered on the shade. It wasn't Mille. It was his uncle, Lebre. She wouldn't say that. She wouldn't. She just wouldn't.

"Ok, ok. Look, Lille's a great school.

A |but| was coming. Al wasn't a subtle man.

"But this is a big opportunity. And it will save a lot of money. Most importantly, it just fits her. She's mechanical. She likes making stuff. What's wrong with that? What harm could it do? Let's give her a head start.

He was struggling.

"Anyway, she's had Catholic school for years. She can always go back. Or take the doctorat. Whatever she wants. But now, the Laboratoire de Chronométrie wants her. They found her. She wants to go.

Al had said more than usual. Defiant. Uncharacteristic firmness in service to his girl. She was worth it. He summed up.

"And I think she should.

Danica made a face. She had pushed hard for Zélie to take an interest in spiritual, cultural, medical, or even political studies. Anything! She had secretly dreamed of her under the lights of |Conservatoire de Paris|. A modern Élisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre. That musical vision had been subverted. Danica knew she shouldn't blame Al. Still, more and more often she did.

The track put food on the table. It had once had glamour. Glamour that had pulled her to Al twenty years ago. Tempted by him, even before she had refused to escape Besançon with Georges Marat, her erstwhile betrothed. Refused to adopt the name |de Saulcy| for a life of melodrama on the run. Then came Zélie. And war's hardships. Where had the glamour gone?

Zélie naturally followed after her papa. Keeping her off the actual asphalt was Danica's first concern. Driving! She couldn't have her child driving in circles at one hundred and seventy kilometers per hour. Anything but that.

Achieving this by letting Zélie get mixed up in |chronometrage| was a pyrrhic victory at best. That Émile Carpentier had been waiting there was unforeseen. Taking little interest in Al's doings at the track, how could she know? Mille, nephew of Lebre and grandson of Jules. People Georges had spent time with. Therefore, people that knew of her. How much did they know?

Nothing of the sort had been uppermost in mind when she first dragged Zélie to piano lessons at Saint-Joseph of Reims. But the lessons were by happenstance taught by Émile's sister, Marie. Such a huge family. Carpentiers were everywhere. As were old disappointments and deceptions. Danica felt trapped!

She had seen Saint-Joseph's as Zélie's stepping stone to |l'Université Catholique de Lille|. She had not thought further. Instead, the stepping stone led back in the direction of |l'Observatoire de Besançon|. Back to the messy passions of time. Disagreeable, unacceptable, possibly dangerous, and seemingly inescapable.

Besançon University had, out of the clear blue sky, offered a paid internship. Jobs were scarce. Technical education would enable Zélie to join the grand project to rebuild France. How could the family say no? And yet! Was the sky really clear? Was it even blue? The timekeeping, the piano. How did everything lead inexplicably back to Besançon?

Danica had buried Besançon deep the day she walked away from the name |de Saulcy|. She had gone right to Al in tears. He never knew the truth. And now he could not know. And, especially, Zélie could not know. And yet, she suspected that, somehow or other, they soon would. Georges's graying harbinger and his ridiculous |nom de guerre| hid behind every door.

"
Zélie's parents escalated their fairly decorous Saturday evening tiff into a lumbering Sunday rumble. Zélie slipped downstairs and left. Her mind was made up. They would fight, she would ignore them. They would acquiesce. Or not. Regardless, she would go. It was her life.

Zélie's bike was a beauty. A nine-kilo Aviac rando three-speed in bare duralluminium. Hand-hammered fenders. Lightweight glued joints. The headlight was replaced by a chrome reproduction of René Lalique's |Victoire| mascot: a woman's head, fierce teeth apart, hair streaming in the wind. The machine was a gift from the wealthy owner of a racing team. Their car by Alfred Barraqué. Their winning lap times by Zélie. She would have to work five years to save enough for such a |velo|. She rode it like she stole it. Eyes crying in the wind.

At the track Zélie peddled through the garage out to the staging lot. Leaves blew. There were only a handful of mechanics. Cut gloves and barrel fire. In the field only eleven lonely cars. She spotted Mile's Gordini Type-8. It looked cold. She quickly hot-wired it. Warmed the engine, spun the car, and ripped through the gears, hitting one hundred kilometers per hour in six seconds.

A few minutes of tight turns later Zélie saw a panting Mile running to the dirt oval waving a ragged checkered flag. She slowed and pulled over. Mile leaned on the door heaving. Zélie rubbed her swollen eyes.

"Mademoiselle, I am badly in need of a ride.

She leaned over and flipped the handle. He crashed into the seat. They paused a moment before they spoke.

"Nice car you stole. The owner must be proud.

Mile's eyes crinkled.

"The owner is in trouble. He may have to walk to Besançon to retrieve it.

Mile nodded. It indeed seemed likely the poor owner had a problem.

"You look a bit too happy for such a fine day. We can't have that. How may I be of service in breaking your mood?

A wry look. The car rolled.

"My parents are fighting. Apparently, Mom wants me to stay home and learn to knit, or something.

Zélie's mouth was tight.

"Hmm. I could use a hand-knit fire blanket. Why not? I'll give you five francs for it. While you're at it, I'll give you six if you wash and wax my car that you stole.

Zélie pondered the economics for about half a second. They went back and forth in this way for a bit. Sniffling slowed. Slow left bends on an empty field. Gradually, Zélie explained about the fights since she brought the letter home.

"I'm going you know. I don't know why Mom is upset. I don't care. She can go to hell, I'm going.

That's when Mile took a risk. He had long thought that he would. He did it for a friend long vanished and for the rebellious girl he had come to cherish. Gently and, he prayed, accurately. She could search out the details for herself. And it was probably time she did. Maybe he was wrong. But he felt it was time Zélie heard the name |de Saulcy|.

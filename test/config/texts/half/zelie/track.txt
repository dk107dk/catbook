In her second year at the track, after months of tutelage under Mille, Zélie made her first contribution to the art of |le chronométrage|.

After windows were washed and floors swept, Mille soon enough taught Zélie two key activities: timekeeping for individual cars to half-second precision or better, and, more importantly, to keep a lap chart of the positions of all the cars in the race. Charts were important. Zélie was proud to keep hers as accurate as the old hands. Soon, she thought they might be even a bit better.

A lap chart is a grid of laps to drivers that shows the progressive positions as each car crossed the line. An accurate lap chart determines the outcome of heated arguments and the headlines of local papers. Soon Zélie was taking turns keeping the official chart. That made her one of the most popular or notorious denizens, according to the fortunes of the teams and the skills of their drivers. She was meticulous. She accepted no guff. By the end of her second season, her word was law.

Then came Zélie's first innovation. It was to the challenge of timekeeping for individual cars. When she started, tracking her papa's team, of course, she found it difficult to snap the stopwatch crown down as the car crossed the line, remember its time to be written later, and reset the watch for the next lap. It was nearly impossible to do all three things within half a second for dozens of laps without error. Zélie's reaction time and working memory were good. Her fingers got stronger. She was better and better day by day. And yet it was hard.

These problems were, of course, solvable, in principle. The track was managed by part-timers and run by volunteers. There was some income from club fees, race sponsorships, various team charges, parking, and commissary commissions. Sadly, the income was fully spoken for. Electricity, rent, police and fire, grounds maintenance, and many other costs. Had there been copious funds for timekeeping, there were options. |Rattrapante| chronographs and stopwatches with |retour-en-vol| complications had become available. Tripwires and fully automatic photo finish systems were used in the States. All manner of advanced experiments existed somewhere – just not at Reims-Gueux. Reims-Gueux was the country fair form of the Grand Prix.

Between races Zélie spent her time learning other things. She learned to do simple stopwatch repairs first. Then she sneaked away from the Pavilion to watch the mechanics work on the engines. Leaning into their work was easy. The mechanics were charmed by the young girl with oil on her coveralls.

The mechanics and their machines gave her ideas. She imagined the leverage of long arms extracting spark plugs. She saw the reciprocal action of horizontal and vertical pistons turned into rotary motion. She learned about racks and pinions. And she examined high-power equipment with heavy quick-disconnect safety switches on rubberized mounts.

Luckily for Zélie, dusty, oily parts of all kinds lay thick about the garages just waiting for her to think up experiments. With a few boards and metal angle brackets, she made a box with two mountings. She required a large knife switch. That was harder to find and required an expedition.

She rode her bike to |Dubois Artisans Électronique|. Nearly knocked the bell off the door. The backroom had what she wanted. At first M. Dubois, proprietor, was unconvinced that a ceramic-base knife switch salvaged from an electrical substation with not too much rust on the terminals should be Zélie's for a few centimes. His doubts were eventually overcome by Zélie's fervor for her mission.

The knife was connected by hinges on arms pushed by a rotating half wheel to brackets crimped to the stopwatch crowns. Pushed in one direction, the switch pulled up a crown and depressed its opposite. Push the other direction, the reverse. The assembly was first thrown in anger with Mille and M. Dubois looking on as Alfred gunned his Gordini-Simica prototype in |Bleu de France| across the line in a personal best on lap one of a ten-lap time-trial. He was so proud to immediately see Zélie's timings that he pushed past his chief with the engine still knocking.

Zélie, however, was not so thrilled. The knife was too heavy and slow. It stuck on the pull and push. Each time jerking and rattling the box. The box was unwieldy. The mechanism too fragile. While better than a one-watch manual approach, constantly checking its function and looseness seemed likely to result in operator error. And anyway, where would she find more large knife switches to satisfy demand? It wouldn't do, no matter her papa's and Mille's enthusiasm.

She stomped off. Back to the noise and bustle of the garages. The men were focused on the next heat. The engines bucked. Not for the first time she encountered starter relays firing exposed engines. She had seen starters disassembled, snapping and revving on the bench. Had felt steel plungers striking iron blocks. Heard stripping gears whine. That day it clicked.

The starter relay is an electromagnet, a solenoid. Its function is to pass a jolt of high-current electricity from the battery to the starter motor. When the driver pushes the button, the relay is triggered with a small current. It connects heavy contacts that activate the high-current starter motor. At the same time, it pushes the starter gear attached to the starter motor into the ring gear of the engine's flywheel. That communicates the starter motor's rotational force to the internal combustion engine's piston action, triggering the compression and ignition cycle. The engine starts.

What Zélie now realized was that the way the contact pin moved to arc the carbon leads and the way the drive gear jammed into the clutch was not entirely unlike how her stopwatch crown was jammed down to freeze lap times. This was interesting! Could a strong enough solenoid be mounted to trigger a stopwatch? She thought maybe so. And if it could be, could it also simultaneously be made to pull up another crown? Maybe! Perhaps no heavy knife switch that jerked the box with an external force was needed.

Zélie exited the garage to kick rocks and contemplate switches in the back lots. She knew what was needed. It had to be a momentary switch with internal latching. In effect, like a starter button. But requiring only the lightest touch. Just a tap to set the crowns of two watches firmly in an instant. Unlike a starter that ran only until the pistons fired, the momentary contact would trigger a constant current, keeping the solenoid plunger pinned.

Soon she was describing her vision to M. Dubois. His involvement with the tangled-haired |inventrice| had grown. He had become, in effect, a sponsor. In an idle moment, he wondered if his shop should have its own banner at the track. Regardless, they drew a crude diagram of Zélie's more sophisticated system. And together they pitched the idea to Mille. He called the head of electrical systems repair. With four heads nodding Zélie got to work.

She requisitioned a battered but functional starter relay, along with an old high-capacity lead-acid battery. The Broadcast Box was prevailed upon to release an old |Ducretet| telegraph key. Mille's watchmaker helped her repurpose the winding mechanism of a large pocket watch to drive the polarity reverser.

An electrics technician helped her modify a solenoid into an open-ended reciprocating linear engine. Its plug knocked one way when the current ran plus/minus, the other way when the polarity was reversed. Zélie soldered brass clips to the ends of the plug. They acted as hard points for mounting the stopwatch crowns.

The polarity reverser was fixed under the modified relay. It comprised a spring-powered movement stripped down from a robust old LIP SA Bombardier Timer. The center wheel was retarded by an escarpment-derived ratchet. A downward tap on a light release arm allowed the spring to drive one-half turn of the wheel. Properly wound, the release would spin the wheel that half turn in well under one hundred milliseconds.

On the wheel itself, Zélie mounted four half-circle horizontal copper wings in two layers. The layers were ninety degrees offset from one another. Between the two split disks were a pair of conductive carbon brushes mounted one to each. The brushes were attached to the top and created a circuit against the bottom. The halves of each layer were separated with paper insulation. Solenoid engine leads attached to the top wings, the battery leads below. Once the telegraph key was affixed to the ratchet release arm and balanced, the assembly was ready.

The cars bunched on the track. They hit two hundred and forty kilometers per hour past the sweating timekeepers at the upper windows. The air shimmied and turned blue. Zélie tapped her finger as her papa flew past. In less than one hundred and fifty milliseconds his time was recorded and the next lap timer started. Zélie calmly wrote his time into the lap chart. The circled timekeepers, pit bosses, and mechanics broke out in cheers.

The switch became known as the Momentary Zélie Lap Timer. Zélie had learned about watch movements and circuitry. She had gotten comfortable with currents and reversible fields. And she learned carbon, copper, brass, solder, insulation, and ceramics. It was well that she had absorbed it all. More Zélie Timers would be built by her alone, paid for by eager race teams.

By the time she was done with her manufactures, Zélie had accumulated craftsman's tools and was getting a solid grip on supply and demand, supply chains, and the fine art of parts scavenging. Her bank account had accumulated more francs than expected. And |Dubois Artisans Électronique| had indeed hoisted a racing-blue banner above the Chronometrage Pavilion's track-facing windows. While not in the largest letters, Zélie’s name was on it.

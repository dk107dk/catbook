>1951 - Zélie's signal from Besançon University, France

"Time is of the essence of a cafe

Zélie Emmanuelle Barraqué occupied the narrow table that rocked slightly in the window arch of |La Belle Aurore| on |Rue du Lyceé| in the provincial seat, Besançon. Her favorite haunt. By that point, at that hour, virtually her table. Light was fading. The table's candle was an unlightable stump. Her physics readings were not illuminating. She didn't see the connection to watchmaking. For her, a more creative endeavor.

The cafe's walls were papered in varnished news print. Folded in diamonds, layered into fish skin. Headlines and obits. Adverts and astrology. Images from a dim yellowed world. Commentary aged into summary. The cafe had no wall clocks. That didn't mean it ignored time.

In the course of human events, there is a moiety. For some, I am, therefore I must have been what led me to become. For others, I am not yet what I soon will be. Zélie didn't put it in so many words. If asked, she was the latter. And fiercely so.

At about six p.m. she straightened. Mentally slamming her uncooperative physics while physically closing and slipping it into a leather tool bag that clinked metallically. Her mug found its way to the bar. Her name was on the bottom. She buttoned a worn felt coat. Pulled her handmade scarf in a |bergère| wrap. She saluted the bar and exited into the evening. It was cold.

Across the narrow street was the entrance of the preparatory school |Collège Victor Hugo|. Slick cobbles. Granite and slate. A pair of modest perron steps mounted to twin iron-bound doors. Between the doors, a reliquary to Louis Pasteur, |Fontaine du Lycée|, dry and cold. Across from the shrine to Pasteur mounted on the educational monument to Besançon-born Victor Hugo opened a narrow lane memorializing Émile Zola. Pasteur's bust gazed down the lane. Over it, the discoloration of letters lost to rust: |À la défense du temps constant|. Zélie never noticed the fading words.

Zélie turned left down |Rue Émile Zola|. Hurried two blocks whistling a halting |Clair de lune| through chattering teeth. Climbed to her crowded students apartment in the eves over |Place Pasteur|. She felt alone in Besançon. She was, then.

Spring was coming. And with it, a new work-study position as |Assistant du Chronographe| at the Besançon Observatory. Zélie felt she was not yet what she soon would be. Of that she was confident. She was in Besançon in large part because she knew now she was not what she thought she had been. On that point, too, she was clear: she had had no idea.

Feeling alone, tangling with abstract physics while learning to assemble infinitesimal springs and levers, Zélie experimented with life. Without self-awareness, she emitted a signal. The signal was of two units. Their direction of travel was west. They crossed channels and cities, forests and farms.

The units were at an angle so very shallow. By the meridian of their arrival they had diverged by only a few miles. In time, they were received by a particular pair of observers. One in Holmes Chapel, the other at the Victoria University of Manchester. These observers implicitly measured the experimental signal. Imaginary calculations were implied. Had they conferred, the observers' measurements would certainly have agreed. If ephemeral, the signal was in certain respects strong and compelling. The so-called observers, though, in fact had no idea.

How can we know a lonely girl living with a personal puzzle while struggling to probe minute mechanical mysteries in her first year as an aspiring watchmaker had signaled thus? We know because soon those two observers would converge on that source. And tellingly, the three would recognize each other all but immediately. That, despite differences in time, motion, and space. Circumstance had entangled them in a timeline of events well worth the telling because of their becoming.

***
Not many days later, Aubert and Phaeton walked in the |Le Coq et les Étoiles|. Cori and Zélie had only just been served drinks. For various reasons, the four of them, in various combinations, were bumping into each other a lot. Cori waved them over. Two more places were set.

The |brasserie| was half full. The group's conversation started slowly. Phaeton had just met Aubert. Cori had just met Zélie and Phaeton. Zélie knew Aubert from work, but they hadn't ever hung out.

They sorted through their connections first. Cori, by a few years the youngest, had not yet toured the Observatory. She and Zélie had planned that for the next day, Saturday. Aubert looked forward to seeing them. As did Phaeton. This was only his second time seeing Cori, despite growing up only a few miles away. He eagerly sat across from her.

Quite soon after, they got to the matter of their differences. Cori was the standout. She silently brought that fact to the fore. As usual, she captured attention easily. The excuse for the others to focus on her was her delicate entourage. They sparkled in time with her dark eyes.

Eighteen-carat gold veins, fragile silver bones showing through copper and golden skin thinner than tissue. Cori had commanded them to hide in sweater folds, behind her ears and collar. They peeked out. Compound eyes glistened. The table candle turned their antennae and forewings into excandescent filaments and sparkling firebombs. Smiling shyly, Cori shivered her shoulders.

On that signal, her minions spiraled out and up. They danced on the waves of heat the candle dumped into the currents. Were they butterflies? Moths? Dragonflies? Does metallic ontogeny recapitulate mechanical phylogeny? Whatever, they flew!

They felt the tropical moisture of breath. They rode nitrogen breakers curling up and crashing on warm cheekbones. They wanted to land their sensitive feet on the fields of gossamer hairs. To taste with proboscis and labial palps. They wanted to explore these giants that faced their mistress.

"They are so beautiful! You are Chronos, for sure.

Aubert was ever the partisan. His fervor was well hidden behind amazement. This was his first encounter with the young clockwork sorceress. He had heard observatory interns talking. He hadn't known who they were talking about.

"What do you mean? I hear you say this but what does it mean?

Phaeton had been mainly with the director. Philippe oversaw both sides of this academic cold war and consequently never spoke of it. Phaeton also intuited that he was the odd man out in this arena. He was Astro. He didn't know how he felt about that.

"C'est idiot. The astronomers are treated as weirdos, outcasts at the Observatory. And it's an observatory!

Zélie laughed. She liked challenging Aubert.

"There's a bit more to it than that.

In dinner conversations roles and alliances rotate rapidly. Aubert sensed suddenly he had become the odd man out. He felt the need to explain. Zélie didn't give him a chance.

"There are more of us, of course. We have more practical work to do. But that's not a great reason to make a big fuss. Explain yourself, mister.

Aubert was actually looking for an entry. He was on familiar ground.

"Oui, oui. Let me. There's suspicion between the departments, yes. Historically we have watched each other like hawks. It is since the beginning of the Observatory, really.

Phaeton was nonplussed.

"Why?

Aubert considered his words.

"You can blame the first director, Louis Gruey. À mon avis, he had some strange ideas! And he behaved strangely. And then he died strangely. His wife went insane and shot him. She said he was a monster "from beyond time". What would you think after that?

Zélie snorted at Aubert's air quotes.

"I would think the man should have married someone else!

Cori chortled adorably. Phaeton was distracted. Aubert continued earnestly.

"When they found her, she was incoherent. She had shot up her bedroom like she was firing at ghosts. They apprehended her huddled like a human gnomon in the center of the analemmatic sundial. She tried to shoot anyone who approached. Luckily her pistol was empty.

Phaeton didn't see a clear connection to the professional divide in a story fit for tabloids.

"The thing is, Marie was convinced that her husband was manipulating time. That he was somehow using his knowledge of the heavens to distort spacetime. She thought he dragged everything he touched far into the future. Or aged it unnaturally. Or something.

Zélie looked skeptical.

"Or maybe elle était folle, alors. She was nuts! What does it have to do with astronomy?

Phaeton echoed her even as she spoke. Oddly, he looked defensive. One might think this wasn't his fight.

"They say that you can see it in the sundial in the circle. Its copper is completely worn away. Do you know how long it takes copper to rust? Millennia!

Cori knew all about copper. She interjected quietly.

"What does that prove?

Aubert was not dissuaded.

"Louis snuck around, he built the Observatory with features nobody's ever explained. Tunnels, dampers, crazy deep wells with unknown machines so rusted you can't tell what they are.

Aubert was gesticulating crazy gears or an insane robot as only a French horologiographer on his second |Bière de Garde| can.

"The few things he wrote couldn't be published. After he was killed they found notebooks filled with crazy calculations, impossible star maps, cyphers, and predictions. It's said that some of the things he predicted have come true. Like World War II, television, antibiotics. And more things that we can now see coming. Lasers, atomic clocks. Things that in the eighteen hundreds he couldn't have imagined.

Phaeton shivered in spite of himself.

"Have you seen any of this yourself?

Aubert looked defensive.

"A few things. But the Police Judiciaire arrived soon after the murder. The Observatory was shut up during the investigation. When it reopened many things had been removed. Mainly from the Astros buildings.

Cori looked challengingly at Aubert.

"Why didn't they take the sundial?

Aubert looked like he scored an unearned point.

"I think they did! What you see could be a reproduction. Maybe the original was taken by the investigators and replaced for an almost identical one. I don't think they picked up on the significance of the degraded metal. That copper dial – what's left of it.

Zélie looked away. Apparently tired of the topic. She signaled their server.

"How about this, let's feed you a few more drinks and see if your story changes? In the meantime, let's talk about something else!

The conversation slowly turned around on its axis to point to other things. The |Championnat National| rankings, student loans, the history of the Besançon Commune, watchmaking, Cori's creations, and more. They lightened up. Not exactly a foursome, more of a three-and-one. Nevertheless, they had a good time.

A couple of hours later a moment happened. Aubert was sitting close to Phaeton's right. His watch was within inches of Phaeton. At that time, Phaeton and Zélie were a Pelforth or two beyond Cori and Aubert. Aubert had slowed down to attempt to be observant. Cori just preferred Orangina.

At a certain moment, Aubert checked his watch. His upper body slightly jerked. Cori, seeing this, quickly reached out. She asked him to show her his timepiece. Train of thought broken, he raised his arm to her. She gently tipped his wrist to the light.

It was a locally made LIP T18 1947. A fine machine, improved by him. She tapped it and murmured in appreciation. Her fingers lightly touched his hand. She looked up at Aubert with a distracting smile.
Gradually Aubert reeled in his arm, eyes locked on her. Then he slowly looked down at his watch again. Tapped it. Frowned. Looked back at Cori. Looked suspiciously at Phaeton. Looked for the waitress. It was time for the check.

They parted with Aubert on the corner of |Rue de la Madeleine|. He hurried away from the city centre. His apartment was by the science campus. He wasn't headed there just yet. He had a stop to make. Hrique was waiting. Aubert still had to report in.

The others crossed |Pont Battant| on their way up |Grande Rue| into |la Boucle|, the old city. Zélie shared a garret apartment. Cheap unfashionable rooms tucked under the eves of an elegant building. It was shouldered tightly into the classical and provincial facades of |Place Pasteur|. Cori was couch-squatting. She didn't take up much room.

Phaeton was half a mile further. He was camping in an apartment of an academic who was gone for the summer. It was on a road off |Place de Granvelle|. Halfway to the foot of |Mont Saint-Étienne|. Just around the corner from |Musée d'Histoire de Franche-Comté|. He was about a three-mile ride from the Observatory.

They said goodnight. The lamps were dim. Windows mostly darkened. Phaeton pulled his collar up and walked. Briskly but not entirely steadily. The long narrow blocks were deserted. There was something about the curving streets. They had no horizon and few outlets. The stone buildings rose abruptly, forming a trench. They were oversized dark alleys.

After a few minutes, Phaeton caught a man out of the corner of his eye. He was across the way several doors back. It was nothing. Yet, having noticed, he couldn't not hear the steps. A minute later they changed. The man had crossed over. Behind him. Closer, not closing. Or was he?

Phaeton thought there was muttering behind him. He thought of Marie's ghosts. The horror she had for whatever it was Louis had become. The brooding museum-palace approached. A Second Empire monument to a locale with a full share of the dark side of French history. Steps coming closer. He thought of running.

Suddenly, at the corner Phaeton was tangled up in two leering drunks. Startled and off balance, he found himself in the street in the headlights of a car moving fast towards him down |Rue de la Préfecture|. It was at once both an excuse to run from the fear behind him and a present threat. Did it swerve towards him, rather than away?

Phaeton scampered across the street between two parked cars, twisting an ankle on a sewer grating. Tires chugged on the cobbles behind him. Squealed around the corner. They were heading in the same direction as he was. He ran pell-mell diagonally through the square towards |Place du Théâtre Ledoux|.

Reaching his sheltered steps, Phaeton got the lock open. The shadow pacing him veered behind the Theater. He slammed the door and doubled over. Phaeton was not a runner. His hands shook. A car crept up the street and slowed at his door. He ran up the stairs two at a time. Burst into the apartment. Double-locked the door. Heaved in the dark kitchen for several minutes before peeking out the front window.

The car was gone. A cigarette tip glowed in the shadows of a recessed door. Phaeton checked the window locks. He tried turning the radio on low. He wouldn't hear feet on the stairs. He turned it off. Sleep didn't come quickly.

In the morning Phaeton was slow getting going. He had a mild hangover and a dark cloud over his head. Something wasn't adding up. Leaving, he walked over to the doorway where he had thought he saw a smoker's embers the night before. There were stomped cigarettes. Which proved nothing. And a blocky symbol stenciled roughly in black. About waist high. It was like the iron cross, but with a bow for the transverse. It looked fresh.

Phaeton stared dully. Then it clicked. The symbol for infinity superimposed on the stylized silhouette of an hourglass. The hairs on the back of his neck rose. He clenched his jaw unconsciously. This ancient city and its damned obsession with time!

Phaeton pulled his bike from the alley. He rode quickly away. The golden butterfly standing watch across from his apartment stayed where it was.

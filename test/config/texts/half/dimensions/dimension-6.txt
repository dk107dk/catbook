>A Pause in Inaction

The taller one was growing restless. He felt time passing. It passed ever faster. When he focused on it, it passed faster still. Nothing in the star-lit land changed. Nevertheless, he felt he was slipping further away.

The smaller one was different. She was of a time and a place. And he felt her coming near and drifting far. Ebbing and flowing. Sometimes fading away. The taller one found it agitating. He stood up. And as his head approached the stars she grew fainter. He looked sharply down.

So that was it! He exclaimed to no one.

The whorling points in the dark sky stood mute. They watched him pace looking down. He stopped and touched the ground. And he paced more. Until, at a certain moment, he stood straight and looked around.

What did he have to work with? He looked at his shadowed self. He considered the soft earth. For a little while, he dug with his bare hands. He didn't make progress. It was frustrating.

Then he looked again at the stars. The points of light he couldn't grasp. Yet he could easily move them. He paused in thought. Tentatively he reached out. He encircled a cluster of stars. He nudged them. They moved. He corralled a few. He herded them into a tight ball.

Then the taller one straightened, reached far out, and took a deep breath. He swept the blazing ball down out of the roiling sky. It crashed into the earth with violence. A catastrophic fall from the heavens. Merely a side effect of his burning determination.

The blast dug a glowing, boiling trench. The ground shook. The taller one stepped down that first stair. He felt the smaller one. She was a tiny fraction nearer. The taller one smiled grimly. He had found a way. He would drill straight through the earth to get to her.

He reached back into the stars to continue.

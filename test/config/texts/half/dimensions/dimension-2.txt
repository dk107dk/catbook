>A Pause To Collide

The taller one was working out a position.

Positions of things had coordinate systems. Their gradual motions were reassuring. They could be calculated and predicted. They behaved according to laws. There were just a few laws. And they were simple. Combinatorially, he thought they might explain much. He figured he had time to work it all out.

The smaller one was focused in on energy, motion, heat, and work. There were spins and handedness. Resistance and superfluidities. Temperature and pressure. Fields and manifolds. All these things to measure required names and units reconcilable. Gosh, there were a lot of them!

She hypothesized much. Gradually she came to rely on massive sampling to know that she was right. Generally, she was.

They concentrated on their work. Then unexpectedly they backed into each other. That was distracting! Their trains of thought broke away from the spinning bubbles in the sky. They realized what had happened. It was the first traffic accident in their speculatively dim land.

They turned to each other with questions.

"Why don't you watch where you're going?

The smaller one wasn't mad. She really wanted to know.

"I was turning and you weren't even looking. How come you didn't see me?

The taller one felt he was in the right. He was good at observing things.

"You accelerated too quickly. I couldn't see where you were.

The smaller one wasn't especially aggrieved. What would be the point?

"If damage were visible we would know who was at fault

||at fault| had air quotes around it. Again, no point.

"You are more massive then I am. If I had bounced away would you have said I had left the scene of the accident?

The taller one smiled. Or at least he thought he did. It was hard to know.

"We could argue about this one little thing forever, couldn't we? We might never be sure of the facts.

The smaller one was sure that that was the case.

"Perhaps we should just forget it and keep moving?

The taller one thought she might have smiled back.

"Yes, perhaps you're right. Let's just keep moving.

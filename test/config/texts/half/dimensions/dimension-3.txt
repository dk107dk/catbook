>Yet Another Pause

The taller one was fond of conjectures. The smaller one was fond of puzzles.

The taller one was abstract to a fault. The smaller one was imperative in the extreme.

The taller one was hungry. The smaller one had already eaten.

They both preferred |To Have and Have Not| over |The Big Sleep|.

They, therefore, agreed they had at least a few differences. It made them as individual entities a bit easier to identify, despite the dim mood lighting in the land of spinning stars.

They often commented on such things. They did it in a conversational loop. The loop stretched and bent. Nonetheless, it remained homomorphically encoded. Certain heartfelt information remained unexamined no matter how often they returned to their topics. So it goes in a sensory-deprived stargazing party for two.

"The stars are beautiful

The taller one was sure of his facts. He knew about stars, though in his past experience stars had been more sedate.

"They are not stars, silly. They are particles.

The smaller one felt she had logic, reason, and evidence on her side.

"Really? Do we know how close they are?

The smaller one was unsure what the question meant, exactly.

"They are where they need to be. I can reach out and touch them.

The taller one squinched his nose. The scales seemed all wrong.

"When I try to touch them it's like I can't quite. They move away.

The smaller one wanted to help

"Try picking just one up. They are discrete.

The taller one tried wrinkling his forehead.

"I can't touch the individual ones. But I can cause waves of them to move really fast.

The smaller one now seemed puzzled.

"Interesting. When I try to make one affect the other it doesn't really work. At least not how I thought.

The taller one had an idea.

"Maybe we could work on them together?

The smaller one liked that idea quite a bit.

"Yes, I'd like that. Then we should be able to do anything.

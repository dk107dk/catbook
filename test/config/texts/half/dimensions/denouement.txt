>A Pause Ends

The taller one was tired. He was losing focus. Tunneling and blasting progress was slow. Was there even progress? Where was he going?

And yet he felt a quiet presence approach. It was warm. It glowed. He looked up and about, anxious to find it.

And then, simply, she was there. The smaller one walked quickly over. Quickly meant all kinds of things in the dim land of flying stars. The taller one was glad that this time it meant the smaller one was shortly in his arms.

Amongst the shadows they found abundant time. Time to embrace. Time to catch up. Time to talk.

They talked of fire and fury and imperial incursions. They talked of shoes and ships and sealing-wax. Of calibers, chaos and chronometers. Of suns and stars and galaxies far. And love and other inexplicable things.

They left much to others. The future to artistic observers with their mirabile eyes. The striving dead to the puzzled survivors. They withdrew from unknowable physics. Of caring versus chaos. Of control versus creation. And of cartoon strategies versus a capricious reality. For once, from their perspective, the world in all its mess was balanced. Others, though, were left with serious uncertainty as to nature of their being.

And then, in a certain moment, they joined hands and simply walked away.

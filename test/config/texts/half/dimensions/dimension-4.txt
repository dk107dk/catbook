>A Pause of Pauses

The smaller one was beginning to worry.

There was a world beyond the dim land. Important things happened there. At some point the next one would occur. She wanted to be there when it did. It was exciting to think of things happening one connected to the next. Change, creation, action.

The taller one felt her gathering tension. But he was busy pondering the past and the future. It was hard to tell which was which. He would practice. If he could tell the future from the past he could know what he had done and what he would do next. That seemed worthwhile.

If only the smaller one would slow down.

"I have to go soon.

The smaller one felt it was right to give a warning.

"So soon? It doesn't feel like it's been long at all.

The taller one was a bit deflated. He wondered if he had done something wrong.

"It's been like forever, silly. Don't worry, I'll be back soon. Before you know it.

The smaller one was reassuring. She was used to comings and goings.

"I know you'll be back, I just don't know exactly when.

The taller one was sad. He moved slower than the smaller one. He knew he would feel less sad when he knew exactly when the smaller one would be back. That gave him an idea.

"Let me see your face, so I will feel connected to you when you are far away.

The smaller one was surprised she hadn't thought of that.

"Will it work? Can we actually see each other's faces?

The taller one was sure that it would. The smaller one hadn't considered it before. But it seemed reasonable. And exciting.

"Let's try. Come really, really close so I can see you.

The taller one bent down. The smaller one tilted up.

"Closer

The smaller one murmured.

"I see you

The taller one whispered. He thought she was beautiful. He had had no idea.

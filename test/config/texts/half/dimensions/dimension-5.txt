>Waiting For a Pause to End

The taller one was waiting for something. He found it hard to remember what, exactly. Broad brush strokes were fine. But details? They grew confused. They took so much energy.

Were he to focus he could know what would happen. Eventually, it always did. His world was predictable. Things happened exactly as they had had to happen. Or so it seemed. He wondered if there was some way to speed things up.

He considered time. It was woven into the whorling stars. It was right there. And yet the distance was numbing. He barely felt time passing.

Causality seemed spotty and suspect. Was he omniscient? Surely not! Had everything already happened? Or was what actually happened just him gaining knowledge? Knowledge of what would inevitably happen, at some point down the road?

It all made his head hurt. He drifted. Occasionally he twitched back into alertness. Nebulas roiled. Stars rolled.

He missed the smaller one. She was not there. He kept looking for her.

And, yes, he remembered, that was what he was waiting for. She would return.

Oddly, he knew nothing about this pause. Surely it must end soon. Knowing so many disconnected things to a certainty was a distraction. Not knowing when the smaller one was coming was painful. It crept up on him. He jerked in spasms.

Time was so tired. It lay down in a dim land with a livid sky.

The taller one tucked in his head and closed his eyes. Occasionally stirring and crying out. Sometimes dreaming. Mostly just waiting out the pause.

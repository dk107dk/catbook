>A Pause To Reflect

The undulating ground rolled darkly below. Complications wheeled overhead. They lay on a highlands staring at the sky. The dim view was captivating.

In that land, at that time, there existed doorways. They stood here and there. Occasionally, a doorway would shuffle from place to place. It was quietly amusing.

The taller one felt doors without walls were unusual. What would be the point? The doors were distracting. He preferred observing the sky.

The smaller one was more interested. She approached a door and kicked it to see what it would do. It was as solid as anything else in that world.

"Should you really disturb the doors? Maybe they aren't for us?

The taller one worried for the shorter one. She was so curious. He felt protective. She was drawn to the unexpected.

"I'm going to open it and see what's there.

The smaller one liked adventures. Maybe the door was a small adventure. She reached for the knob and turned it. The door opened.

"What do you see?

The taller one propped himself up to look. Where this was going? He hoped she wouldn't go through.

"I'm not sure. I see... myself? I'm looking from behind the door back at me.

The smaller one hurried to the taller one. She wanted him to see.

"You are behind the door with me.

The taller one felt that was worth seeing.

"If we are already on the other side of the door, does that mean we are the kind of people who walk through random doors?

The smaller one pushed and rolled the taller one downhill as he mused. They tumbled a bit. Now they could both see through the door.

"Look!

They saw another couple. One taller, one smaller. The others gazed back. They held hands.

The taller one felt his face flush in the dark.

"I think they look happy.

He could barely get the words out.

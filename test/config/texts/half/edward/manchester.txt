***
Some weeks later, at four a.m. a farm cart pulled into a narrowing cobbled street in the canal-side Castlefield commercial district of Manchesterthum, Lancashire, hard by the River Mersey. Day was creeping aggressively into the distended sprawl that would come to be Greater Manchester. The cart clopped. The lamps were out. Numbers, hard to read.

Even that early, coal ash rose thick. Manchester was rising. Then the fastest-growing city in the world. Wool rolled off the moors. Cotton from the south. Silk from the east. Power looms. Cable tramways. Canals in aqueducts and tunnels. Coke, tin, iron, and slate from the north and west. The hungry poor poured in from all points.

The driver of the cart yawned and pulled on his cap. He drove the mares with one hand. He smoked. The cobbles clacked. Lights dying. Watchmen asleep. Without widening, as the street progressed, the buildings grew. Traders' warehouses. Four-floor factories. Smithies and stables below jammed-packed dormitories. Sooted brick. Slick cobbles. Coal gas, and sewage.

The cart slowed. Then in the center of the row, to the driver's right a distinctive frontage. Rising a story above the adjoining roofs. Narrower than the warehouses. The cart swerved slightly and stopped. The driver's backboard clunked. The driver stepped over and kicked at a box. Put his foot forward. Grabbed the tarp covering his load and pulled up. A small body rose and quickly rolled over the side falling into the street awkwardly. The figure stood and faced the building. The cart continued on its way.

This tall dark building had the verticality of success in commerce. In appearance, equidistant between warehouse and headquarters. Rough structural granite quoins. Bronze bulkhead lamps lighted the corners. The first floor stretched upwards. Cast iron stars bolting blackened brickwork. Burly scheme arch lintels. Heavy stone risers. Iron boot scrapes. Above the entrance, a heraldic owl clutched a telescope. In its beak, a banner heralding Mystic House. Below in Gothic script the motto |tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis|.

Will Ashlar stood and stared at the words. The door stayed shut. Sleep shivered down his ill-clad spine as he stiffened to present. To who? He wished he had a clue. Everything was new.

A lamp flared in an inner hall. The tall oak door had a row of three small iron-framed diamond lights. They allowed enough glow to illuminate the steps. Will felt observed. Shortly, footsteps. Then a click. The door opened fractionally. A dark silhouette asked his business. Will gave his first name, no more, as he had been instructed. The door opened enough for Will to see some hall. The shadow stood back. Will straightened himself and entered.

"
Five floors above in a vaulted loft a shadow within the shadows crouched below the heavens. A massive brass and steel nineteen-inch achromatic refractor telescope rose almost twenty feet above a dark raised pulpit. The shadow was hunched and insubstantial. It was several minutes before it moved.

The instrument's console was accessible by a rolling catwalk. The platform was pinioned by four eight-inch toothed iron beams. The beams rose ten feet above the roof. Four great iron-toothed wheels, each fitted on one beam, were mounted in heavy trucks built into the platform's edge. Counterweight lines hung down shafts behind. The platform had enough play that the great refractor could be fully retracted below the roof.

Over the street and canal, the roof lay flat behind a corbiestep facade. The left and right sides were topped by a low masonry parapet with thick merlons. Between each pair, an iron comb with six sharp tines. Hip-beveled roof lanterns ran close behind the parapets. Their copper frames rose five feet making defensive glass and metal berm. They glowed faintly from hanging candle lanterns.

In the center of the roof was a low brick riser. It carried long metal doors running front to back. They opened to the sky. Each side was leaned back and propped. The refractor rose ten feet over the roof. High, but quite hidden from most angles.

The shadow sighed, unbending its back slowly. Its neck stretched inflexibly and cracked. The northern astronomer sat forward on a bench built for leaning back. He laid his forearms limp on the ascension and declination hand wheels. His head pitched forward. His heart beat inconclusively. His eyes were exhausted. He was at an unknowable remove, waiting while his liminal mind cautiously reembodied.

That morning the boy had arrived from the south. Mystic House had balanced itself. He must soon meet his new protege. Or, he mused, protector? First, though, he called for help lowering the instrument. Winding down. Careful cleaning. Oiling and capping. Shuttering the roof and sweeping the loft. Rust scurf and pigeon dejecture. The practical mundane matters before the mystical infinite returns.

"
"Welcome to the phrontistery young prentice. We expected you. And just so, you have arrived.

Will spun so hard in his chair that his feet left a scudge of shoe leather on the oak. Pewter plate knocked. Mouth full.

"Ah, er. Sir. Ahllo sir.

His voice was high. Tight. The man in black robe carried a wooden box. His sleeve was lined with thin braids. Will's first thought was that he looked imposing. However, stooped over, the man moved slowly. His voice shuffled softly.

"I am Arthur Noshunse. I am docent and resident of Mystic House. You are in Mystic House.

Arthur looked at Will with a phlegmatic eye. Will continued to boggle.

"Now then, what name do you give?

Will thought this a funny sort of question. He was expected. Therefore, according to past experience, he was known. Moreover, the door had known him. That much certain, nevertheless, he had to answer. And this was a challenge for him. Will had decided to be someone new. He had not yet much practice doing it.

"William. William Ashlar. Will, Ashlar.

The man was old and he sat heavily. The chairs were pulled out at an angle. The blackwood table had two. Will was in the other. Dark lace and batting table runner. Wood candlesticks. Stacked books. Papers. Pens. Objects of glass.

"Young Will Ashlar. It is a good name. Solid. Heavy. Indeed, appropriate.

Will stared.

"Do you know why you are in Mystic House?

Will stared.

"You needed to leave London. We needed you to come here.

He paused. Then continued.

"All mankind spins in space as one. Our planet is small. The sum of all things must balance. You have the privilege of being integral to the maintenance of that balance. So, you are here. As our guest.

He trailed off and paused again. He was unsure what to do next. Having achieved the thing attempted, it was no longer a pressing matter. Focus lost. As might be anticipated, he came across as fumbling. He poured a drink absentmindedly. He did not offer any such to Will.

"
Will came to know Arthur Noshunse's fumbling was sincere. And yet also a front. Arthur was unsure of the boundary between past and future. Such a man could never be sure of his footing in the present. Such a man was chronically out of focus.

Arthur knew Will better than Will knew him. Indeed, better than Will knew himself. He caused to appear virtually anything Will wanted, as if by magic. What Will wanted was simple: iron, glass, grindstone, tools, and light. Occasionally food. These things in various contrivances found their way to a basement workshop.

This laboratory was richly appointed for industrial use. Twenty-five feet across, thirty-five front to back. Broad iron-fixed beams. Pegged floor. Workbenches. Enameled slops sinks. Iron stove. Bookcases and cupboards built into the walls. Drafting desks. To one side a smaller room held a low bed, pole lamp, and a rough-hewn wardrobe. At the far end, a narrow but deep bay. It was built as a bronze, iron, and glass hothouse hanging a few feet over the murky canal.

Soon enough, Will owned it. He mounted mirrors and prisms on pulleys. Turned the bay into a kind of light well. On benches, wires and lenses. Saws and hammers. Jury-rigged koniaphostic lamps. Coal-gas blowtorches. Mirrors upon mirrors. Tin, bronze, mercury, glass. A large iron and canvas fan began to draw marginally fresher air up through a housing into the room. It turned slowly on a vertical screw moved by the foetid water below.

"What am I here for? What do you want me to do?

Will, in a moment of outward clarity, asked Arthur.

"Lad, just do what you do best. Plumb the infinitely deep depths of the infinitesimal. Create clocks and lenses. Slow the invisible to an infinitely precise crawl.

As always, Arthur spoke slowly as if his mind was elsewhere. It was.

"But why?

Will tailed off even as he managed to get the question out. He was also becoming distracted. That happened a lot to each.

"Because you can.

Will dreamed of bespoke industrial wizardry. Then he built it. Merely the act acted as a ballast stone damping the sway of the massive brass telescopic mast flying from the deck far above. Will never knew of it. He never thought to ask. He was more solitary and withdrawn than ever. He ate rarely, when it occurred to him. With no Mazy, he grew thin. The Pin and Pall of him emerged ferociously.

"
"And the boy, how is he? Does he resolve the imbalance? Is everything as you saw it?

Arthur lifted his chin off his chest. It had become winter. The fire whispered and popped. He too was thinner than appeared healthy.

Arthur spoke heavily to his younger brother. A man dressed as a successful merchant might. Herringbone vest. Silver watch chain. Dark woolen waistcoat. Subtle silk embroidery. Well-kept hands with stains of moist snuff and pipe tobacco. Henry James Noshunse's small retinue knew their service.

"He is quiet. Ensconced and occupied. His work is prestigious.

Arthur suspected he no longer knew how to communicate with Henry. It was a price.

"Young Will is already old inside. So wonderfully skilled. Yet, something grows not with time spent so.

Arthur took a long unsteady breath.

"Yes, nevertheless, mirabile dictu, an equalizing presence.

He paused again.

"And what he creates has value to your enterprises?

Henry ticked his tongue noncommittally. Perhaps. Likely. He tapped his pipe quietly. He worried.

"A boy was in the road again. Watching the house.

Arthur sighed in the way of one worn out by words.

"A dark blue carriage stood at the cross. Again. Perhaps the same one.

Henry raised a brow, focusing in on the flame of the lighter. His brother moved uneasily. The heavy drapes slowly brightened at their top. The morning peeked in. The room remained dim.

"We stationed a man on the roof across. He reported that figures appeared several nights on warehouses along the road. In positions where one might see the top of the refractor.

He looked at Arthur for a sign.

"They appeared to have glasses.

Arthur shifted slowly to Henry.

"I see vast war and miracles. I see stars spinning with a celestial motion unexplainable, and then winking out in a flash. I see a flood of the unknowable. Night on night on night.

He coughed hoarsely. He caught his breath.

"You want me to know the meaning of men on roofs? Of boys loitering and carts?

He looked down.

"I can barely tell what centuries-spanning canals will make your fortune. Men will breathe steam, climb to the sun, and live in the clouds. Après tout ce déluge. The future? What good does it do?

Henry looked up from his pipe.

"It's our fortune, elder brother. And you never needed a reason beyond transcendent knowledge. Nos mutamur lente.

The astronomer's chest slumped. The brothers sat at the edge of a wide dim world. Only one of them saw scintillating stars gamboling across a dark sky.

Henry eventually tapped out his pipe. Leaving, he spoke with the servants in a quiet voice. His brother needed greater care. He sensed his instructions would do no good. Nevertheless, he had to try. His carriage came around. He stepped up.

That was the last time Henry Noshunse saw his brother Arthur. The next time he visited Mystic House he would find it a smoking ruin.

"
That terrible night Henry's carriage stamped at the catty-corner. He looked through voile curtains. The smoke of lives lost hung in the air. Billowing with it, iron and stone atomized to powder eons before its time. For Mystic House, the future had come too fast and in great fury.

Henry felt the emptiness of the certain loss of his brother. What of the boy who brought balance? Will Ashlar? Henry wondered how the balance had failed. He wondered what might be salvaged. He wondered to what end. What could he do? Only carry on.

Henry mouthed Arthur's cycle:

"  Common invokes singular
"    Singular invokes opposite
"  Opposite invokes balance
"    Balance joins singulars in common

He slammed his fist into the roof of the carriage. It pulled away.

Not far off a young figure huddled in the canal-side shadows, soaking wet and smelling like sewage. A dazed Will Ashlar observed the smoke of the building he had escaped. Clothes, blackened. Hair, burnt. His future barely reprieved. His life did not feel at all balanced.

For the second time in eighteen months, Will was driven forth by an abrupt fire of unknown provenance. This time he would find his own path. From what or towards where he could not say. After a few minutes his nerves stilled. He stood. And he simply walked away.

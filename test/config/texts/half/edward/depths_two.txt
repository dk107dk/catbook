***
Will Ramsey awoke to the rumble of a wagon. Was it evening? It was unusually hot. He quickly determined that was because he had been wrapped in a heavy carpet. The carpet dropped on the curb behind a costermonger. In the alley behind his family's home at 32 Clerkenwell Green, he guessed.

The smells were awful. Carpet mildew. Spoiled vegetables. Clinkers and burnt clay. Horse sewage. Clerkenwell's road ballast was saturated with ammonia. It was suffocating. Having revived, he was fading fast.

A bag of crusts, jerky, and a flask of small beer crushed to his chest. Arms pinned. Shirt buttons tearing. Neck strained from the angle. Raw from the fibers. His legs ached with cramp. It was dark. The very definition of claustrophobic. Only the pain in his face kept him coherent. He waited. Everything was wrong.

"
That morning everything had been better. It was Saturday. Saturdays at 32 Clerkenwell Green were always a bustle. Generously, Will's father gave him Saturdays. The thought of his hands free to advance his own projects raised frisson. Will loved Saturdays.

It had started well enough. He remembered being force-fed. Will's older sister, Mazy, had tipped his glass higher and higher. She had chanted drink up, drink up. Pushing his plate forward. Squeezing his shoulders enthusiastically.

Mazy was a wonderful bother. She had minute-by-minute expectations: eat, wash, church, chores, study, sleep. On and on. None were obviously connected with watchmaking. He tried hard to make her happy. It was quite distracting. And it took time away from his art. Still, she was Mazy, so he tried.

Earlier in life things had been simpler. Mazy took charge when he was four. Will had been a more-or-less normal kid. Mazy had been a more-or-less normally bossy sister. As he grew up he grew more like the older Ramsey men. Mazy recognized the signs. As a girl of seven, she had had to step into the role of caregiver to their twin older brothers. Gosh, they had needed a lot of care! So, she thought, should Will have. Bossy reified into full-on benevolent dictatorship.

Adadas Ramsey blessed or cursed his family with a trait that worked well for him: obsession. Early on he developed a monomaniacal fascination with the many species of escapement in their natural clockwork habitats. Fascination in a watchmaker often predicts success. Adadas's twin sons by his first marriage, Pinion and Pallet, did not do so well by it. The jury was out on Will.

Pin and Pal had grown up under Adadas's bench. At five, it was apparent they would be unusually quiet and punctual children, even for Ramseys. By eight, they were lost in internal chronometrical complications. Mazy fed and cared for them. They grew pale, cryptic, and ruthlessly predictable. But for Mazy, Pin and Pal would not have matured into the journeymen they became. They might have ended up in the poorhouse or asylum. Mazy worried for Will.

Will choked down his cold sausage and milky tea. He ate perfunctorily, distracted. Mazy made sure he was done before his mind or his whole self wandered off.

"Oy Arbor, what you have planned for this fine day?

Mazy called Will Arbor, in keeping with Adadas's tradition of naming the parts of his family after the parts of his watches. As the youngest child of a second wife growing tired of an in joke with no punchline, Will was named first for his maternal grandfather, only second for the hub of the mainspring. Mazy's first name was Collet. She preferred Mazy for reasons.

It was a fine day. Mazy thought she knew what Will would say. He had explained a pattern of small burns to her a fortnight ago. She was right.

"To the Observatory. Calibrating the Helios Concentrator. And yes, I'll be careful.

Will's so-called Observatory was a closet-like shack on the roof. It led to a ridgeline catwalk for sweeps. A window, a trapdoor, shelves for tools, a makeshift bench, and a stool. It was maybe five square feet of floor.

Will had improved it with a small platform. The platform was cantilevered over the slates to one side of the door. And he added a primitive dumbwaiter to avoid the risk of the ladder. It was all quite rickety. Despite that, shack, catwalk, slates, and chimney had been there many years. They seemed unlikely to fall four stories into the alley. True, it was cold in winter. But there was no competition for the space. On bright days, the light was outstanding. And you couldn't smell the privy.

What then in this so-called Observatory? No less creative, it was nothing like the four floors below jammed with watchmaking. As small as Will's space was, he could breathe and think. He could do his own thing in peace.

The building below him had been patrilineally common to three generations of Clockmaker eschevins. Adadas and his forebears were forever tweaking it. The frontage on Clerkenwell Green was rough, commercial, and yet handsome. Brick and beam, twelve box sash windows, and a slate roof. By the entrance, blown glass shop windows offered tobacco and small goods. Featuring Ramsey watches, of course.

On the left, the building was party-walled to a bakery. On the right, an alley almost large enough to be called a road. That side faced south and had most of the windows. Overall, Will's world was a thirty-foot-wide by sixty-five foot deep box. The back faced a rough blind alley shared with a tavern, a dosshouse, and various other craftsmen's workshops.

Inside 32 Clerkenwell was dark. Oak floors. Whitewashed brick walls tarnished with candle and kerosene smoke. Lamps with mirrors. Clocks everywhere. Not a few cobwebs, despite the constant activity. Like all London, the Ramsey's workshop and home was a complete firetrap.

At the front of the first floor Jeremy Ramsey, Adadas's older brother, kept a shallow tobacconist cum watch sales and repair shop. Behind that, stock rooms, a pantry, a counting room, and an eat-in kitchen. A tiny metals workshop hung off the back beside a communal privy. Coal smoke, hot metal, and human waste.

The second-floor was filled by ranks of apprentices and journeymen. Pin and Pal had benches, along with an occasional freeman on hard times. The third floor held offices, a walk-in closet with strongboxes, quieter workrooms, more materials, and a bedroom. The fourth floor was jammed, even by comparison to the ones below. A jumble of family spaces. The ladder to Will's Observatory was in the back.

The Ramsey home was a factory. Raw materials in the back. Small lots of new watches out the front. Distribution was handled by the Marson brothers, distaff cousins across Clerkenwell Green. Components were sourced by a nephew behind St. Johns. An uncle on the Strand handled finances. A family business to the utmost.

The house was a tinkerer's paradise. Will was one of the lucky few born beset, in love with what they can't avoid. Unaware of the misery most lived, Will was merely satisfied. He became productive at an early age. Soon he paid down the deficits of eating his father's food and wearing his brothers' shoes.

Will rose to a place of importance. His tiny hands were nimble. Eyes, sharp. He could happily work twelve hours at his bench and still need to be called multiple times to supper. At supper the family discussed work. Will's contributions were limited. Conversation was rife with analogies. Face plates, balances, jewel bearings. Between that and the family naming scheme, it was near incomprehensible. Consequently, few not of the Company stopped by for dinner. The family was fine with that.

Will mumbled through a chunk of hard bread as he exited for the roof.

"See you later, sis.

In the top of the Observatory Will had cut a hole and mounted a window glass. It had nested concentric circles carved into it. Soon that would become known as a Fresnel lens. Around the window above he had positioned a double semi-circle of speculum mirrors, finely polished. They tracked the sun. Their rays hit a smaller speculum mirror that was angled to down.

The light passing through the Fresnel was strong. Spider arms of secondary mirrors, counter mirrors, and lens ensured no particle of light was wasted. Cranks ran through the ceiling. They allowed Will to turn the concentrating mirrors to follow the sun. More arms offered glass spheres, lenses, mirrors, and grills. It was a catadioptric cat's cradle.

When he last stopped, Will had been attempting to create a wide-field projected image of the microscopic. An object was mounted in a watchmaker's vice. He had positioned compound lenses left, right, back and front. The enriched light source was split into four rays. Each ray channeled part of the object. The four beams of brilliant illumination reflected the image from mirror to lens to mirror.

The resulting images were finally projected into one. Four perspectives stitched together in a panoramic view. Will's goal was to cast the most minute features into an immersive view at magnification levels unheard of. He wondered if it would finally work. And if it did, what would he see?

Light was the problem. There was never enough light. He had sneaked into Humphry Davy's arc light demonstration a couple of years earlier at the Royal Society. Since then, he was consumed. Will dreamed of light. Blinding flood magma, diamond occultation rings, carbon arcs, and explosions of light.

Adadas dreamed of light too. He simply wanted sun on his employees' benches. There weren't enough windows. The building was long and narrow. A few months prior Will had described a kind of periscopic solar-tube. Having described it, he was actively avoiding working on it. It had issues. And it didn't further his work in the microscopic. It was, however, a means of justifying his annexation of the Observatory, absconding with materials, and spending time apart. Adadas suspected as much. He wouldn't admit it, but he gave the boy leash.

Under his fathers tutelage, Will was well on his way to master-watchmaker. And yet, that had become the least of his explosive interests. Will’s fascinations led to deep investigations. The biology of infinitesimal creatures. Empirical materials science phenomena. Fine metrology of the subtlest forces. Pressure, temperature, expansion, cohesion and adhesion, and other mysteries.

These pursuits demanded light above all. The |sine qua non|. Without light, there was no scale. No depth. Nothing existed without light. But with light – light and optics! – his world was as a wide and deep as the universe. Limited only by his mastery of what would become known as the photon, Will had become a breathtakingly incomprehensible combination of ocularist and microscopist. He cast his own light, seen only by him. He was on fire.

All that fancy stuff aside, Will's tardy delivery of sunlight left Adadas's cryptohorological minions grinding down their eyesight by oil lamp in a cave. However, the would-be solar conduits at least made great speaking tubes. Will cranked them up and down through the floors. He could twist them to focus directionally. Amusingly, he could hear everything.

There were two tubes. One protruded up into the Observatory. The other was down the catwalk by the front chimney. In truth, the tubes were a serious pain. Their optics were questionable. London's air was far too often foggy, damp, or full of soot. Will struggled to keep water out of the tubes. The watchmakers below found it challenging to aim them. The mirrors tarnished rapidly. They were hard to extract for polishing. All this made the tubes just another experiment that didn't seem likely to go anywhere. The building was full of those.

To that point, nobody on the lower floors had realized Will was listening. At that moment, all was quiet.

"
Forty-five feet lower and four-hundred feet north-west on the other side of Clerkenwell Green, two men sat stiffly on a bench. They dressed as prosperous craftsmen. Their purpose was anything but quiet.

The heavier one carved a block of hard cheese. His mustache relished each inbound chunk. He wore a hat. His slightly damp wool jacket was thrown over the bench back. For all his serious purpose, he looked to be fully focused on his food.

The other man was tense. He had no jacket and no cheese. Shirt clean. Hat combed. Adel Rust Daniels was called Aurf by his friends. There weren't many of them. Aurf looked at his pocket watch as if they had recently fought. He looked up to the building in front of them and saw something.

"Aye, Clapper, stuff that. He's there in the window. Look, man. Let's go.

The heavy man Aurf had called Clapper, despite being the more unkempt, was the senior party. James “Clapper” Castings was the proprietor of several of the Clerkenwell and St. James district's dozens of spectacle retails and workshops. He was sweating, hungry, and pissed off. Someone had moved his cheese, so to speak, and he was right annoyed about it.

"Aurrrf. Right, you. With me.

He heaved himself up, buttoned his watch pocket, leaned forward and back to settle his soles, and marched explosively at the steps of the nearest premises without once looking at his mate. He didn't forget his jacket. Aurf stood, spit, and hurried after. At the corner of the Green, a lanky boy straightened, turned, and ran off up Farringdon Lane.

The cashbox behind the counter in the front room of 17 Clerkenwell Green was jammed. Someone had let a penny slip into the hinge and then tried to close the lid. This made the box very insecure and quite annoying. Fists were pounded. Cuts sustained. Monty Marson, antiquarian, barometrican, purveyor of mercurial and aneroid instruments, as well as a wide selection of his cousin's fine pocket watches, and anything else his broad and deep network of craftsmen was offering for cash on the barrelhead, was having a day.

Monty had his back turned when Clapper Castings banged open the shop door. The big man caught his foot on the sill, raked a fat hand painfully across a display of sharp-edged mounting brackets, twisted uncomfortably looking for something to put an arm on, and crashed to the floor. His fall dislodged a large brass gate lamp with a claim tag, a box of new pocket watches, and a hapless flower pot. The latter shattered. Clapper was covered in baked clay and premature comeuppance.

Aurf angled himself carefully around the door. He stepped over his boss, disregarding Monty. Leaned down to help. Clapper batted his hand away. Heaved. Breathing hard. Feet wiggling, kicking, thrashing. It was an entrance guaranteed to make an impression. Monty was only the smallest bit amused. He had found a long-handled flathead screwdriver fit to pry the box hinge. He gripped it tightly. It wasn’t trying to escape.

Clapper was a known quantity. He had nursed a running feud with Monty going back more than a dozen years. They had sat in the Sessions House for far too many hours. Backbenchers backstabbing with backbench daggers. They kicked banquettes reflexively. The few words between them had not lessened the tension.

Outside the House, much the same. They exited from opposite Guild Hall doors. Fighting continued on any number of fronts. For example, what day of the week it was. If the sky was really blue. And who had the freedom of the district to sell glassware, philosophical optics, and other visual aids. This last was the sticking point. As a tradesman, Marty would not be bound. Whatever Clapper wanted was unwelcome. Presence in his shop, bad news. Monty rang a bell to summon his boys.

On the other side of the Green, a group approached the Ramseys' shop. They wore glassmaker's aprons. Nearby three boys with augmented eyesight loitered on the cobbles at the pissoir. They flipped gravel in the attempt to splash each other. Carefully not looking at numbers 17 or 32. North, where Aylesbury disgorged into the square, a cheap workman’s spectacles seller hawked ten-penny wireframes. He wasn't trying very hard.

The Green was a hive of activity. A significant fraction seemed to be trying to look casual. Despite that, jaws were tense. Trouble was brewing. Sunlight reflected off glasses flashed in every direction. Monty's barometers were falling. Nobody was paying them any mind.

"What the ever-loving bloody fuck, Clapper! You snitting sod! Break that lamp you own it. And you can tell Father John yourself why you took the Lord's light in vain.

"
By this time, Will was deep in his experiments in the Observatory. High above the commotion. And yet also far below in the microcosm. Insensitive to the clash of commerce. The sun shown. Mirrors concentrated. The Observatory glowed. Thermometer pegged. Door and window propped open. Handmade blue-glass spectacles on. Sweat poured down his arms and back. The alignments were good. The aether burned! Will was in his element.

Falcons must experience this, he thought. More than sixty elements with untold degrees of freedom. Fractional adjustments smeared a landscape dry as death across the hand-polished mirrors. A heat mirage that looked, for all he couldn't know it, like the pit of a dive bomber's stomach-crushing inverse parabola rushing up at him.

Angles and canyons. Stiff spiky foliage the color of skulls. Cubic boulders with delicate tendrils. Cliff walls rushed past, advanced by a clockwork anthroscape. Sunbeams off metallic cliffs. He plunged with every twist of the focal screws. Time above slowed as he fell into something entirely new.

Will's rapture largely overrode his bodily senses. He never felt the concentrated sun burning wedjat lines around his eyes. Nevertheless, a sluggish self-preservation struggled. Muffled thumps, crashing, and urgent voices. The solar pipe was doing its best to get his attention. Bad things were coming to a head below.

"
Clapper in enraged embarrassment threw the vicar's God-forsaken brass lamp at the wall of Monty's shop. As it happened, that wall was offering shelves of delicate instruments. The noise was cataclysmic. Monty cringed and spun. Glass sprayed in a perforating horizontal hard rain. Monty was a big man. He didn't cringe much.

Three things happened next. Aurf stepped back in haste, reaching in his pocket for his knife. Clapper stepped up, carried by his throw, and his pique. Monty swung back around like a rubber band with a fist swinging wide. Partly for balance. Mostly to connect with Clapper's face.

The screwdriver's long shank bit into Clapper's chin as it ripped by. Clapper flew backward. Airborne for the second time in minutes. Right then Monty's eldest son, a burly two-hundred-and-twenty-pound standpipe of the name Hambone, landed a shoulder square on Clapper's breast. Though he didn't know it, the acceleration briefly put Clapper at the fastest his body had ever traveled.

He didn't have time to enjoy it. Both men crashed down the front stairs. The hit was hard. Clapper didn't move for a long time. Aurf landed hard beside him with a screwdriver-sized hole where his shoulder met his neck. There was a lot of blood.

Men in fine glasses had come running from the four corners. Shouts and thrown objects. Men on the stairs. Monty couldn't get Hambone in and the door shut. Windows broke. Monty's other son had the axe handle.

The melee rolled into the storefront. The number of teeth loose on the deck increased rapidly. Monty could tell reinforcements had arrived by the hollers, thuds, and grunts outside. Whose? Then a shelving board landed on Monty's head. His chin hit the counter. He missed most of the kicking he took.

"
Over at 32, the fight reached the landing below the second floor. Spectacled heavies had overturned the displays and thrown cases of tobacco through the windows. Watches had been stomped. Several bodies were down. Blood, vomit, snot. The cash box was on the floor. Coins everywhere. There was no thievery. This was a righteous King Mob riot with vengeance top of mind. Freemen shook fists. Iron bars pendulumed at heads. Drills swung in anger. Jewelers hammers tomahawked. Someone screamed.

Forty-five feet closer to God, time had paused. His sister's scream finally had the power to reach Will's distorted senses. Mazy wrenched his auditory nerve. His optic disc convulsed. Will spun back up to the glacial procession of the world of men. The ersatz speaking tube was barking and warbling. Distant crashing. Someone on the green had a whistle. Horns blew from two sides. A bell rang.

About this time Will became aware of smoke. Not the coal smoke of the furnace. Not the smell of burning refuse. It was a house fire. The ominous smell of city death. Will's family's house was dying.

He almost fell down into the cramped bedroom below. His and his brothers'. No thinking. Just instinct. He pulled a canvas bag out from under the lower bunk. It was already full. His life in one small bag.

The noise was coming closer. Urgent cries. Heavy objects crashing down the stairs. Smoke. Pin backed into the room. He leaned back to hook kick an intruder.

"Get out now!

He gestured wildly at the ladder. As he followed his center of mass forward, he slammed the door shut with him on the outside, Will inside. Will jumped for the ladder.

Reaching the Observatory, Will swept burning hot lenses into his bag. A corner of his mind knew torching the place was no longer his concern. He ran down the catwalk. Leaped down the north slope. Slates broke and skittered. His foot caught on the flashing. He tumbled five vertical feet onto the flat adjoining tar. His palms stung. He was briefly laid out. Then up. He ran across to the next roof. Angry shouts behind him.

Five roofs over was yet another watchmaker's workshop. The district housed tens of thousands of watchmakers, stone carvers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, glassworkers, and practitioners of sundry other crafts. Close quarters bred conflict.

Uncle Johan was an old codger. His stern sons were not close friends of the Ramseys. Still, Johan himself was gruff but kind. He had had Will on his hearth when Adadas had the pox. Will threw himself on Johan's slates. He crawled on ripped knees to the trapdoor. Hammered on it through tears. It rose up suddenly, breaking his nose.

"
When Will came to he was trapped in a rough smoke-damaged carpet. Face swollen and burned. Urine, blood, and water-soaked his pants. Sharp edges cut through his bag. Lying on the cobbles like refuse.

Everything hurt. He cried silently. Cart wheels slid to a stop by his head. Urgent muffled voices. Suddenly he was in the air. Thrown to the boards. An incremental insult to his ribs. The horses stamped distantly. The cart moved off slowly. Slowly it picked up speed.

Will was heading to something new. To what? He had no idea. He could no longer be young Will Ramsey. Amid the troubles of weeks and months, he yearned for solidity. The name that came into his head was that: Ashlar. And in that moment that's who he became.

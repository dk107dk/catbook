1974 - Overriter and Noshunse in London

Captain Mariel Lena Overriter hit a button at the top right-hand side of her gray metal desk. There were three: red, green, yellow. They were mini-Fresnel lenses held by a scratched screw plate. There was a keyhole and a small dark glass, like a microscope slide, beside them. The red one began blinking.

Locks kerchunked on each of the desk's drawers with a force that lifted papers. Two heavy iron plates with deep grooves rose out of the surface on each side of the desk. They clicked solidly into place. A segmented steel cover began scrolling up from the back of the desk, feeding into the grooves. It covered the legal pads, binders, and papers. Only the lights, keyhole, experimental fingerprint reader, and a heavy brass desk lamp remained exposed.  Overriter needed coffee. She expected to be right back. Lowering her office door's steel grating seemed like overkill.

Overriter's office was an eight-foot square. So tight that shelves completely wrapped her desk. There was little space for her chair to roll. None to tilt back. Where you could see the walls, they were beige. Where a window might have been, a homemade needle-point sign hung from a shelf at a drunken angle. It read: Rank below window. The books were mostly technical, or they were binders with curling labels that were tired of sitting still. When she left she locked the door.

The kitchen was on three, Overriter on four. The linoleum bent and buckled. Her corfams squeaked on the rubber treads. Squeaking was attention-getting. Overriter was against it. She minced down the stairs attempting to minimize the noise she made. Looking silly was also not her thing, so she kept an eye out for traffic. The Captain was new to the outfit.

The kitchen was lit with long fluorescents behind yellowed and slightly warped plastic sheets with dimples that did nothing anyone could perceive. It was ugly. Unappetizing. She had lost weight. The room had few snacks. It put her off food in a similar way to how eight-foot Atlantic swells put her off food.

Oddly, she thought of the similarity to Atlantic rollers almost every time she entered. After that thought arose yet again, she quashed it, recognizing an unhealthy habit of rote thinking forming. And after that, she recognized that is what she always did, so she instead fixated on the coffee pot. The coffee was always low and bad. She observed this every time she entered. Thankfully, the observation's veracity and the pathos of the moment helped break her train of reflecting on her patterns of thinking.

Overriter made her own life complicated.

She filled a cracked mug with a bright logo that wasn't that of her employer. The water-turned-coffee swirled from the inflow of water masquerading as creme. A firm, low, and gravelly voice suddenly swirled around Overriter's head. She was startled out of daydreaming. Soft heel clicks echoed in the doorway behind her.

"Overriter, my office.

She spun. There was nobody there. However, two things helped the Captain understand what she had to do next: it had been Colonel Noshunse's voice, and Noshunse had the office directly across from the kitchen. He had taken that office expressly with the intention of doing what he had just done to Overriter: he terrorized unsuspecting coffee drinkers. It was the power office of the building.

"Sir, do you need something?

Noshunse didn't look up. He had a magnifying glass the size of a four-cup egg poacher. He gestured impatiently to approximately where the one straight back chair stood beside the door. Overriter sat carefully.

"Captain, did you observe the convergence this morning?

Overriter had not observed any such. She was loath to say so. Having no knowledge of what her commander was talking about she was forced to answer the direct question with a direct negative. Noshunse harrumphed.

"The young man from Motherwell and the young woman from Jodrell? This is in your area.

The Directorate of Unusual Patterns and Linkages was a high-concept SIGINT tripwire with a cracked-linoleum budget. In some wag's opinion, in the coffee-fueled late-night conference room of creation, it was best described as: DUPLIcAtivE. That didn't stick. Who knows why not? DUPL did.

DUPL stemmed from World War II systems thinkers' pondering a confluence of changes. Centralized command and control was loosening. The vast increase of higher and higher-tech signals was overwhelming. And the predilections of an influx of demobbed London Controlling Section anti-strategic deception boffins were not to be denied. So DUPL materialized, seemingly without effort expended by whatever shadowy forces were ticking off boxes on their bucket list.

It had been a cold war environment. Having a feel for unusual patterns that might indicate social engineering was then a strategic imperative. Over time, the mandate of DUPL grew to include everything from spotting strategic technologies before they became publicly available to foreign intelligence to spotting destabilizing conspiracies before they became criminal, dangerously influential, or too close to sussing out government secrets.

And as a natural byproduct of DUPL's hair-trigger observation network, they began to see things that were hard to explain to rational individuals. These phenomena, or at least the impact of belief in said phenomena, or indeed the phantasmagorical DUPL perceptions of the aforesaid, appeared more frequently than you might imagine. The unit began to keep things it couldn't explain close to the vest. That bred a conspiracy-minded culture. It also attracted conspiracy-minded people, even as DUPL was intentionally fading itself into the background.

Noshunse was not a conspiracy-minded person. At least in his own estimation. He was statistical, empirical, and experimental. He loved a predicted and replicable result. In his eyes, a thing was only real when it was verified six ways to Sunday. He was patient with the slow progression of multiple generations of individuals under observation by his team. They had to get the facts right.

The Colonel was less patient with his staff members themselves. In projects management, Noshunse saw patience as not remotely a virtue. He perceived Overriter to be an intelligent dreamer who needed to focus, get out from behind her desk, and get into direct action in the real world. This had been conveyed by him to her more than once. It had not yet been taken on board.

"The Mystic case, sir, is that right?

Overriter stuttered. She had not noticed anything of note that morning. Mystic or otherwise. Moreover, she was struggling to remember the details of Mystic. Her caseload was too high. She was far overworked. She felt she needed the coffee that she had been interrupted from drinking.

Noshunse was also struggling. His struggle was to understand why his unit was so underfunded. Had he the wherewithal, he would have A-players. The kind of analysts that would be on it ten hours a day poring through the open-source intelligence and building contacts networks. People who didn't need to be told. People who would come to him in great excitement when five threads were coming together, three of them long-standing, high-value DUPL targets.

Noshunse threw a copy of the Manchester Evening News on his desk at Overriter. It was folded, social pages uppermost. Below the fold, under the main columns, there were some announcements. A marriage lead was circled in red ballpoint.

"Marriage of Saharalee Athair to Paul Tanine

Overriter took the paper from Noshunse's desk gingerly, as if might bite. She quickly scanned the two-inch box. It told her not much. However, it wouldn't have told her much of anything no matter how detailed it was. With Noshunse glaring at her, it was hard to think.

The Colonel used his fingers to explain, as if to a grammar school student who wasn't paying close enough attention.

"Paul is the younger brother to Aalana. Aalana is married to Voight Schiller, who is the son of Amber and Baron. Aalana and Paul are the grandkids of Charles Chesterian. Saharalee is the daughter of Zolacur√©e and Phaeton Athair. I could go on. Is any of it coming back now? Anything?

Overriter thought that it was, begging your pardon sir.

"It is quite a family tree.

Noshunse was further incensed. The family tree was the least of it.

"Get your bloody daft arse up to Manchester smartly. Don't make me do your job. I want a full report and a fresh wedding carnation on my desk by the end of the week.

He paused for breath.

"And what I want to know, above all else, is what the bloody hell is drawing all these threads into one. How is that even possible!

Overriter thought it was certainly most unusual, sir.

Noshunse thought she was a damn fool that should mostly get the hell out of his office and begin working for a living.

>1940 - Half meets Edward in Manchester

The first time Edward Ashlar, thrice great grandson of Will Ashlar, set eyes on the woman now going by the name Ester de Saulcy he was in no position to notice her. His mind was troubled. Edward's first wife had passed five days prior at Saint Mary's Hospital during a difficult birth. She had been thirty-one, he thirty-nine.

England was lurching into a war footing. Saint Mary's patients were being transferred from the city to Adlington Hall and other locations in Cheshire. There were many sirens. The news was all or nothing. God and country. Black or white. Edward’s vision, all black.

Through connections, Edward's struggling newborn son was able to stay put. He grieved, bewildered. Ester, the ward night nurse, and her other few remaining infants, did not register. Ester worked quietly, her English improving day by day. She did what she could for her last premature child.

For days Edward wondered, what was the point? What next? He struggled as his boy struggled. Tiny, discolored, and malformed. Unable to function alone. Edward stared at the tiny body. Sleep that didn't strengthen. Eyes that couldn't open. Edward's own eyes didn't seem able to close. In the second week, the child finally lost his battle.

Summer 1940 crept forward week by week. Preparations for the expected planes became a much-needed distraction for Edward. Then bombs began to fall. High explosive cardioversion. Edward’s arteries twitched. Sere adrenal channels rehydrated in a rush as the ground shook. Smoke, broken masonry, screams. He named his dead son Corentin, the tempest. They went to war together.

"
The winter before, Edward woke one morning to a rattling at his kitchen window. He rubbed his eyes. Found a dressing gown. Stumbled downstairs. The tiles were cold.

Army green and gold tapped inflexibly. One Lieutenant Colonel Russell Noshunse. A somewhat worn field officer first-class with a handful of papers in a twine-bound leather portfolio. He entered, stooping slightly, like an occupying force. Albeit one barely recovered from serious run-ins with malaria, shigellosis, Cairo street food, and shrapnel. Unbeknownst to Edward, the newly minted lieutenant had only recently acquired a capacity if not to suffer fools, at least to not punch them. Such are the growth opportunities of colonial postings.

At their kitchen table, forage cap, pen, papers, insignia, portfolio were carefully arranged. Silver eyes looking over rimless silver glasses. Noshunse took several runs at making Edward understand: this was happening.

The British Army was executing its royal prerogative to upend Major Edward Ashlar's life without recourse. Noshunse answered questions with barely concealed patience. Why Edward's kitchen door? The Lieutenant Colonel was the retiring type. Yes, suddenly Edward had become a Major. No, it wasn't elective. Yes, he would dress the part. And yes, his monarch thanked him for his service to the Crown.

In that way, Edward's Castlefield workshop had been completely requisitioned, long before the first explosion. Found fit for purposes that had not been immediately explained, preparations were made for it to be expanded. Concomitantly its commercial output went to zero. Edward's head was soon spinning.

Shortly, he found himself the wizard at the center of the Navy's Experimental Poly Chronologics Project, EPOCH. EPOCH meetings had a way of leaving him tongue-tied in acronyms and unsure if he'd just promised to build a perpetual motion machine. The wizard was a bit befuddled and a poor speaker of militaryese.

Edward and his few employees were hit by a whirlwind. Tools, instruments, benches, mini forge, sundries, down to the ceramics, fittings, and screws had all become shipping crates without bills of lading. Loaded by men in green on green trucks heading for a four-story repurposed factory building with blacked-out windows in the ugly industrial outskirts south of the Ship Canal.

He caught his breath momentarily, alone in the empty Slate Wharf mill floor. Then almost instantaneously found himself in the cacophony of trucks, six pallet jacks and a dozen men on a loading dock. The dock took up most of the first floor of a hollowed-out factory. It stood amid a mile of similar factories being rebuilt and expanded at breakneck speed. Eventually, the military built out three floors for EPOCH. His team was expecting part of one. Eventually meant by the week’s end. The efficiency was bracing.

All that hustle was in service of a perceived critical allied materiel gap. EPOCH was the secret program to create precision military-grade watches that displayed multiple time zones, provided multi-step countdowns, synchronized on contact, were made of nothing but snap together complications, and other unusual capabilities. Multi movement watches, some with mechanisms no larger than a match head. Integrated. Hardened. Forged from alloys with numbers for names. Results were needed urgently. Edward took a flat across from the gate. He was never there.

EPOCH indeed delivered all of the above and more. Small batches of miniaturized magic left the premises weekly in matte steel cases with bulletproof single-use code locks handcuffed to the wrists of lieutenant colonels and commanders. The so-called chronologics pieces were instrumental in coordinating assaults, exfiltrating high-value persons, and shaving precious seconds off maneuvers.

Other precision military watchmakers had trouble getting parts from the continent. Some of those struggles were classified. By contrast, Edward's team's only challenge was scaling up their meticulous in-house production to meet demand. They were the unseen senior partners. As such, they were even more tightly classified.

EPOCH was a success on any terms. As far as anyone who knew them could tell, they could produce anything. They achieved so many service firsts and field wins the program was repeatedly up-classified to the point of vanishing. It has never since been acknowledged. Nevertheless, it was all just a sham, though at least not a Potemkin one. Noshunse kept the man he wanted close. Edward had no idea, and even less idea why.

"
Ester slowly became fluent in her fourth language. Little Cori simply went native. Her first complex English sentences were about the possible uses of bomb fins and scrap metal. Her first creations were relatively crude but nevertheless, in Ester's eyes, magical. Attaining five, Cori knew aircraft. Foreign aggressors arriving, British bombers departing. She could read the front page of the News Of the World as readily as Ester. She ate scones. She drank tea. She was quietly precocious.

Ester's job at St. Mary's ended. The last of her premature infants gone. Her landlady, Mrs. Suttons, knew a man who worked at an army infirmary housed in Davyhulme Park Hospital on the south side of Trafford Park. Trafford Park was an industrial estate on the Manchester Ship Canal. It was where they proudly manufactured the war effort – seemingly all of it. The Hospital was just far enough from the factories and docks. It was thought it probably wouldn't be hit. Ester started the next week. She worked a mile from Edward’s workshop. Trafford was a big park.

Starting in August the bombs blossomed. Everyone adapted to the new normal. At the hospital, the infirmary became a triage unit. In the factory, EPOCH production slowed. Blast vibrations became a difficult problem. One November day, green men in tractors ripped a section of first floor outer wall down and staged giant hydraulics, welding torches, massive springs, and great rubber mats, among other kit.

Enormous cranes rolled in at dusk. They lifted the building. All of it. The foundation slab was fitted with layers of springs, bearings, and mats. The second night a work gang mounted two twenty-ton pendulum-style tuned mass dampers. The third night, a ballistic fabric canopy closely matching the original outer walls. A direct hit would obliterate the building. Anything less would barely register. EPOCH production recovered smartly.

However, in the course of this evolution, Sal Corter lost an eye. It was night two of the Big Lift. Sal was a building guard, quartermaster, and resident card throwing champion. He could embed a playing card in a soft cork board from twenty feet, hitting a four-inch bullseye. Sal was well-liked by his mates. Meaning essentially everyone in the building.

He took a splatter of arc welding slag to the face in the rush to emplace the spring-mounted core. There was no corpsman. Edward lifted Sal into a jeep himself. There was a desperate, reckless drive. The attempt to save Sal's face almost cost Sal's life. They slammed to a halt at Davyhulme Park as Sal passed out the second time. Edward carried him in. It didn't look good.

Edward lay down on a bench in the hall outside a makeshift operating theater. Hat over his eyes. He hadn't slept in almost thirty-six hours. Like that, he was out.

"
"Your friend will live.

Edward opened an eye to see a white shape. The shape spoke more clearly than she looked.

"He loses the eye. But he will live.

Ester recognized Edward from the Spring, six months before. He was the sad man caring for one of her last infants. She didn't mind that he didn't recognize her. That hadn't been a good time.

"You have asleep for hours. I bring you tea.

Squinting in the bright light. His eyes adjusted. A white cloth screen had been wrapped around his bench. There was tea. Ester was kneeling gracefully by his head.

"This fell.

She held up a well-used graver. He noticed she held it well. He also noticed that she looked at him curiously.

"Ah, thank you. It must have been in my pocket.

Her face casually encouraged him to continue.

"It is for engraving. I make... I repair small tools. I, I'm sorry, what did you say your name was?

He stuttered to a halt. Ester still held the graver out for him to take. Having lived with those who speak carefully, she knew instinctively why he stuttered.

"My name is Ester. I used this tool too. Long ago, far away.

Her voice was soothing. He trusted it.

"Drink tea. We go see your friend.

Just like that, it happened. One hundred years after Edward's ancestor, Will Ramsey, arrived in Manchester, a fugitive huddled under a carpet in the back of a dirty hay cart calling himself Will Ashlar, with burns on his face oddly reminiscent of the Eye of Horus, Edward Ashlar, the leader of a classified black program he couldn't explain, followed Half, who came to Manchester on false papers as Ester de Saulcy fleeing the Nazis, the Sobek cult, and her Egyptian origins, to the recovery room to buck up a sweet-natured local man who had never before seen a four-story building lifted bodily off its foundations in service to a mission so secret his doctors had been told there had been an incident in the mess installing an industrial-scale bagel boiling cauldron.

Clearly, their meeting was meant to be. Little Cori was in good hands.

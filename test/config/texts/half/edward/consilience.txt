>1815 - 1822 - William flees London

William Ramsey was a direct descendent of the first Master of The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, and oldest son of the then-present of the same office. He had been assigned to carve |Tempus Rerum Imperator| into the soft stone arch over the Company's new Guildhall Library side entrance. A humble start on the road to apprenticeship before he was judged by his betters ready to tune even a modest detached lever escapement. His father thought him capable. Others were waiting to see.

His name doesn't matter. Names have a way of changing. Just think of him as Will. Will's descendant, Edward, will join hands with Ester de Saulcy. Another name that wasn't what it seemed. That event is, of course, still far in the future.

On that first day, Will focused on hammering the ashlar. He ill-used hands he hoped soon to refine, not jar. As Will worked, he mused in youthful impatience. |Te| was for sure a far ways from |or|. The Latin inscription declared that Time is the ruler of all things. The success of Will’s efforts would be a ruling on his future. Apprenticeship with the finest liverymen depended on it. That day, he exercised great care in the unfamiliar work.

The second day, inevitably, Will’s mind wandered. For the first time, he wore his bespoke binocular loupe spectacles outside his little corner of his father's workshop. They were his own design, improved over years. His father encouraged Will to craft the glasses as he sought to prepare his son’s entry into the family trade. They offered a deep view on gears and springs. Now, wearing them outside, Will was tempted to inspect everything. The distraction was irresistible.

His spectacles were nothing like the ordinary optical tools of a watchmaker. A solid front piece housed double lenses screwed into a delicate brass band allowing easy focus. A third lens pair swung independently on articulated filaments resembling animatronic butterfly wings. A counterweight held them as Will's head moved. Two more arms grasped either side of the temple. At the end of each hung a thin tin mirror, positionable on three axes.

A leather light shield cushioned the spectacles' front piece. Two more at the sides. They fastened over the mirror assemblies when not in use. The whole was impossibly thin and ingeniously integrated into an unfashionable but not overly obtrusive accessory. Will didn't look too mad wearing his glasses, at least at a distance.

Leather straps fixed the optics to his head. Will was careful to remove them when using his large hammer. Flying chips were a concern. The glasses were built mainly of scrap and donations. However, Will spent all the money saved from years of odd repair jobs on the magnificent lenses.

The whole was fine proof to his father of mechanical talent. And powerfully useful. To the point that his father constructed his own version. He maintained unusual secrecy from his fellow guild members. Will was precocious. His innovation, precious.

Will paused. The sun was high behind his shoulders. It was unusually hot for summer in London. He leaned forward on the scaffold. Balanced carefully. The illumination was perfect for microscopic viewing. He positioned the mirrors and zoomed in. The volcanic surface of limestone vista expanded around him. He screwed the focal point. Placed the butterfly lenses just so. Pushed on one of the tiny rivets holding the sun shield. The right side was loosening. Something to fix, he noted.

Ridges flew up at him. Pocked and rough. Shadows and crevasses. Terraces big as townhouses. More focus! Colors expanded from blended hues to microscopic bands. Those in turn expanded to rivulets of diverse materials glued together in strata. Sand and pebbles in a long gradual wash. There was a little breeze behind his scaffold. It did not penetrate the desert wastes expanding before him. Down there, all was still, hot, and soundless.

Will used a pin hammer to dislodge a shard from a cliff wall. He zoomed further in. His engraving needle lanced the rubble behind the fall. It gently tipped arm-sized boulders. Tumbled them slowly over an edge of rip-rap and scree. Stone piled in slow motion at the base of the cliff.

Everything in that world moved through sluggish transparent fluid. Gravity was compromised. Time crystallized. He worked his tools. His mirrors sent clouds and light sliding across the land. His needle drew channels. In this way, he carefully crafted a landscape. Ridges and valleys crisscrossed with stone walls and footpaths. They traced out rolling fells ending in cliffs that at another time and scale a north Cumbrian fellwalker might have recognized.

Will felt like a god. He crafted a whole world. His achievements in a mere seven hours would stretch into millenniums of uplift, erosion, and evolution. The timeline on high overshadowed the very different temporal reality of the infinitesimal landscape below. Wild but tended. Natural landforms with the fingerprint of a watchmaker deity.

Eventually, Will’s young spine reached its limits. He pulled up back into the clouds. The atmosphere blurred and receded. His lower back ached as he came up. Will re-entered a world where his omnipotence was conspicuously absent. He pulled down his magnifying apparatus. Checked his pocket watch. A gift from his father recognizing that as time had passed, his son had grown.

It had grown late. Letters remained uncarved. He had been playing god too long and this god had a stiff neck. He would be late for dinner. There would be words. Time, the Ruler Of All Things, hurriedly gathered his tools and cap. His infinitesimal world, lost to sight, left in the growing dark, continued on into its existence alone.

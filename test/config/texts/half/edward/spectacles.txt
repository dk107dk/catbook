Over time, across London, in certain trades tensions built. Soon enough, the Worshipful Companies of Spectacle Makers and Clockmakers were at each other's throats. Conflict enervated the freemen population. Partisans who couldn't see 20/20 found themselves in a Mexican standoff with the faction who cared how long it was till lunch. Spectacle makers declined to venture down dark alleys with poor sightlines for fear of attack. Clockmakers stayed ensconced behind thick walls after seven p.m. for fear of reprisals. It was bad.

This acute diplopia originated in young Will Ramsey's fanciful head-mounted hardware. What to call it? An illuminated abyssal depth-perceiving optical armatured apparatus? Will never referred to them as glasses. That would not have been wise. More than a complete eyewear fashion fail, they were obviously scientific spectacles. Ones clearly not crafted by spectacle makers.

The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers as a whole was unbiased on the matter. The watchmaker liverymen, though, had a keen interest in adopting Will's innovation. Watchmaking requires the balance and ocular acuity of a Hummingbird. Will became a legend. His vision set the city on fire.

The jealousy of the spectacle makers was unbounded. That the watchmakers were not selling depths perceiving devices did not mollify the workshops on the Strand. And, of course, a few inevitably traded at estate sales and bankruptcies. Nevertheless, the watchmakers seemed righteous, if a bit defensive. They insisted they weren't in that business. They demanded to be seen to have done nothing wrong. They closed ranks.

Despite the family's prominence in the trade, Adadas Ramsey, Will's father, was chary of getting involved. Adadas had the blood of an engine maker. He was not a politician or kibitzer. Will was even less a fit party to attempt to calm the waters. Among other things, he was green, obsessed, and oblivious. Craftsmen might steal his ideas. They were unlikely to otherwise take him seriously.

Adadas had of late climbed new heights. The optical enhancement of Will's innovation had enabled him to plumb new mechanical depths. His work grew more and more elegant. All but magical. He was gaining the artistic gravity of an extraordinary master craftsman. It was powerfully alluring. He wasn't about to blow it on market square politics.

Adadas's ability to rapidly fine his work forced his liverymen brethren to themselves tool up. Competition within the Company was brutal. Evermore powerful such optical instruments were produced. There was talk. The suspicions of the Spectacle Makers were riled to a degree that couldn't be easily waved away. Shop windows had broken. Horses had sickened and died.

Meanwhile, spectacle makers determined by careful inspection that turnabout was fair play. The philosophical instruments trade had been challenged to develop observatory automatons, find longitude by instrument, and in other ways jam gears and eyes together.

Aspiring Optiks rushed forward. Diabolical invention ensued. Mainspring-powered star-tracking turntables. Movement-integrated sextants. Gear train-damped self-balancing azimuth pinions. These controversial manufactures began appearing in turn-key embodiments built for export. It was a land rush.

Philosophical engines for clockwork observations not made by liverymen clockmakers were in irrefutable evidence. Discoveries were made. Papers published. Prizes won. Clockmakers unconsulted. There were triumphal looks on spectacle makers' faces. It was as salt to sore nostrils and sand to the butt. The brass teacups at the Guild Hall Library of Clockmaking shook. A mood of vengeance was brewing. Umbrage had been taken.

Once roused, the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers gathered its mechanical advantage smartly. The liverymen were rampant. Years of fierce house-to-house competition made the Clockmakers, once united by an external foe, a fearsome fighting force. They were incensed. And they had hammers, albeit small ones. Damage would be done.

Despite this charged atmosphere, Will was in his own world. Literally. He had progressed over the first decade of the nineteenth century into dimensions no mere spectacle maker could grasp. How did a boy, in less than a decade, gather insights that expanded the optical into the oracular? Hardly something one just stumbles into!

Will had consulted widely. He sought the finest Royal Society minds he could get his pimple-faced self in front of. Equally, shaman artificers known as quacks. The more esoteric the better.

He queried clerks at the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. They encouraged. Librarians of the British Library explored stacks he could not. He haunted the College of Surgeons and the Observatory at Greenwich. In certain circles he became known as "that boy".

And, naturally, Will spied. He did so with great industry. Will "borrowed" from various makers of engines, automata, laboratory glassware, and metrological instruments. Any inspiration, scrap material, or manufacturing process. He was thrown out, struck, berated, and burned more times than he could count. Even briefly jailed. Such was his quest. Scars fade.

His engines evolved. Multitudinously faceted. Liquid filled. Mercury spun. Heat tempered. Interferometers shaved to molecular tolerances. Lens clock-tested diamond-cut aspheric surfaces. Will tried every physical stratagem to control, measure, and focus light in order to magnify his vision down into the utmost minute mysteries. He invented much at breakneck speed. He invented his own world. It went deep.

Eventually Will was alone at the edge of a shadowed world where really small things move really, really fast. In ways difficult to perceive and impossible to explain his experiments entangled him. Mastery of the extreme microscopic accelerated his mind away from the clock-tick of his outer self. His essence left his body's time behind.

As Will sank ever deeper into the mirable, far above him London burned with the conflict of enraged craftsmen. He couldn't have cared less.

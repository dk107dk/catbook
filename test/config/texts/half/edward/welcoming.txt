>The Future

The Bate Hall Hotel in town centre was not far from Edward Ashlar's new countryside workshop outside Macclesfield. Over five hundred years separated the first dug-out limewashed wattle and daub structure from the stone, brick-and-beam public house of 1955, neatly plastered and brightly lit. The hidden old was an enervating weight on the back of the new. Such it is often with England.

To two of the guests, old and new were worn concepts, often creatively used. The public rooms had small tables. One of those two guests took one near the entranceway, by a window, off from the bar. Colonel Russ Noshunse requested his coffee in a heavy glass. A mentor of his had encouraged him in this style of coffee, the way he recalled it, for reasons he could not remember. Manners adopted in the ruddy youth of a junior company officer are not to be questioned. The cream curled a little less distinctly each time he added a drop. Which he did after every sip between burning and lukewarm.

Not long after, Edward stepped in off the street. Looked about curiously. He spotted Noshunse and stepped brightly his way.

"Leftenant Colonel, it's grand to see you, sir. Er, Colonel Noshunse. You have been upgraded, I see.

Noshunse nodded without rising.

"Good of you to notice, Ed. Have a seat.

Edward did.

"Thank you for meeting me so early. It is a big day for you and Ester. New additions to the family, yes? My congratulations to you both!

Noshunse's goodwill appeared sincere. It also appeared carefully constructed. Noshunse, by his face, was completely out of his depth in offering congratulations. He had more practice with condolences. More patience for convalescents. He had little grasp of most family matters. An observer might characterize it as a tin-ear. He compensated by wordlessly finessing the logistics required for a coffee to appear at Edward's elbow.

"Ester and I are pleased as punch. Our Cori found herself a good man. And twins! We never saw that coming. I do hope it happens today.

Edward paused with a distracted look on his face.

"Although, we would have loved to be there with them. They are at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, you see. In the States, near Boston. It's a long way.

Noshunse nodded encouragingly.

"I know it well. A good school.

Edward suspected Noshunse could quote the charter. If he couldn't he probably would have steered the conversation so that MIT didn't come up.

"We plan to head over there for a week this summer. Phaeton's on about some radio observatory the Yanks are building. But they'll all be back home by winter. And we'll be able to watch the twins grow up just down the road in Holmes Chapel. I can't believe I'm to be a grandparent. Brilliant!

Edward wondered about this casual coffee with the Colonel. Even as he shared his excitement with his former commanding officer, it tickled at his brain. Noshunse had appeared out of nowhere exactly no other times in Edward's experience that weren't the cusp of something alarming. Edward's gut assumed nothing about their relationship had changed.

"Both girls? Fraternal, eh?

Noshunse was busy with his coffee. He looked as if he was trying to look busy. Edward suddenly couldn't remember how he had conveyed that information. Or if he, in fact, had.

"Yes, two girls. We're so chuffed. Think, of it. They'll always have each other to count on. And yet, each will be her own completely individual self. Quite a miracle, really.

They exchanged enthusiastic words about sibling bonds and family. On the happiness of the next generation arriving while the grandparents are still sharp. Noshunse was not his often perfunctory self. He spun a well-trimmed yarn about life in Yorkshire. He asked after Edwards cousins, who he remembered hearing about. He inquired if Edward kept up with his men from the unit.

Throughout, though, he also kept a wary eye on his gold watch. It crept out from a well-pressed cuff. Edward was not in the least put off. Noshunse paying attention to time was not unlike Angela Buxton's attention to a wide slice serve, in that he was watching for it and would move fast to counter.

Eventually, Edward had to ask.

"It's jolly good to see you, sir. And yet, it's a touch unexpected. I mean, well, I learned from you to keep my cards close to the vest. I mean, how did you hear, If you don't mind my asking?

Asking the Colonel a direct question in a forward manner still made Edward uncomfortable. Little changes even as nothing stays the same. The Colonel had meanwhile been attempting to signal the staff using an out-of-band protocol communicating conflicting aims: a refill and the check.

"Oh, lordy, man. We keep track of our own, as you well know. It's an important day for you, Ester, Cori, and the young man, Phaeton. How could I not come to give my blessing?

Of course, Noshunse was being ironic. Who was he to bless anything? At the same time, there was genuine feeling, if oddly expressed. His bonhomie wasn't entirely convincing to Edward. There was always a deeper purpose in every move the Colonel made. Who, meanwhile, seemingly absentmindedly, had pulled his watch off his wrist. Edward hadn't known Noshunse to fidget.

The heavy military watch was a manufacture of Edward's own design. His former unit had forged the case, machined the links and assembled them, polished the lens, and engineered the fine-crafted machine behind it. As with most of the team's watches, there were multiple movements coupled behind an integrated face. Edward's eye was immediately drawn. He didn't remember this specific watch.

All of a sudden, the Colonel made several moves in one fluid motion. He firmly pressed the side of the timepiece, which emitted a soft click. Spun in his chair and levitated smoothly from the table. Dropped the watch heavily into Edward's unexpecting hand. Crisply stepped up to a man just about to exit the Hotel. Noshunse's right hand reached out in greeting.

"By jove!

Noshunse half turned to Edward. He used a high loud voice that wasn't quite his.

"Jolly well met indeed, Doctor Sadiki. Edward, let me introduce an old friend, Ani Sadiki.

The man confronted by the Colonel twisted as he slowed. His ability to avoid Noshunse was compromised by the geography of the table, the door, a hat stand, a spittoon, and the news rack. The man's territory was curtailed by an opponent whose expertise in maneuvers was of long practice. The Colonel grasped his arm warmly as he pursued a handshake with determination. The man found himself swung full towards Edward. Noshunse managing this easily despite having skipped breakfast.

The tall painfully thin man made frantic objections. He protested. He was not the individual so named.

"Begging your pardon I must be along.

He had a heavily lined brow and evasive eyes. Thin silver stubble hinted that his jaw might be more fragile than it appeared. His coat was gray, long, ready for rain. By voice and complexion, he was not born to the Queen's English. The accent was hard for Edward to pick out in just a few words. It felt slightly familiar. Edward guessed his and the Colonel's ages to be comparable.

In another second the interdiction was over. The man was gone. Noshunse was seated again. Not at all discomforted by his apparent mistake. Edward just looked at him wide-eyed. It had been a disquieting moment. Edward did not know Noshunse to make mistakes. Or to jump at opportunities for human engagement. He was the opposite of that type. Something didn't fit. What was he even doing there?

"Who was that?

The Colonel was breezy, dismissive of the moment. Apparently a nobody. He had known a character very like the man that had just left once in North Africa. Sadiki was someone you would always remember. A fascinating rogue. Not one to turn your back on. Bit of a troublemaker, actually. He could tell Edward stories. Offhandedly, perhaps another time?

"As always, we choose the time, the other party the place.

With this regimental aphorism as a non sequitur transition, Noshunse rose again.

"I must be on my way. Old chap, sterling form. Keep that timepiece for me. It's marked for an important moment we just had. And congratulations again.

Noshunse paused, raised his other sleeve to look at his other watch. Of course he had two. He tapped the face like a conductor rapping for the orchestra's attention.

"And... There! Your twins just arrived. Go get that telegram and give Ester my best.

And with that Colonel Noshunse was gone. Edward took him at his word. Something had just happened. And the Colonel seemed quite confident the twins had just arrived. Noshunse had never yet steered him wrong.

He stuck the watch in his pocket and hurried to leave. He needed to get back to the workshop at once. No doubt a telegram would indeed soon arrive from the newly anointed godmother, ZÃ©lie. It would say that the infants becoming Saharalee and Anikoni were already busy creating their future.

Louis lost weight throughout 1902. He lost interest in food. He would slip into the director's residence at all hours, collapsing in a sitting chair so as to not wake Marie on the stairs. Louis's hair grayed and thinned. By August he was down more than twenty kilograms. He began relying on a cane. It had a unique brass viper medallion.

That summer, as the distance between Marie and Louis visibly grew, Auguste watched closely. He had concerns, unspoken. Day by day he and Louis, too, passed distantly. Ships without signals. One duly exited Meridian House on the evening hour. An example made for his men, a supper had on time. The other man lumbered to the Equatorial on three legs with a dazed eye in the gathering dark for yet another solitary observational séance under the spackled sky.

Weekly, Auguste's Chronometry Service associates searched for Louis's signature on a stack of rating papers. Staff members left tells indicating Louis's most recent location. As day turned to night, if clear, Louis's orbit became thankfully predictable. He would likely be hunched at the Equatorial Coudé. Or supine under the Equatorial Dome.

If cloudy, Louis would be all but untraceable. Untethered from his observational agenda, his wanderings might take him anywhere. However, given the obsessive hours he kept, Louis would most often encounter empty fields and abandoned buildings. The one building reliably occupied, Meridian House, he inexplicably avoided.

In mid-July, there came a day of fire. The sky broiled. The frame of the equatorial dome jammed and popped as the copper ribs expanded. Associates passed out at the chronometry ovens. On the western hill hazy smoke curled up from dry grasses. Heat-exhausted songbirds, caught between house cats and sparrowhawks, fell dead on the lawn. The weathervane atop the director's residence quietly flaked. Its arrow buckled. Time slowed, staggered, dropped, and lay still.

As the long evening rolled over Franche-Comté clouds followed. Louis was in the Astronomy Department's instrument shop. Head in hands, eyes red, elbows sore, pocket chronometer lying open on his bench. The room was dim. He wore a black frock coat, with no hint of discomfort. It no longer fit. He didn't not care, he was completely unaware.

At nine p.m. Louis gave in to fate. There would be no early observations that evening. Instead, he began his walkabout. Handlamp, hat, watch, rimless spectacles. He wobbled on the bricks between the buildings. His cane clicked. Baked mud, dry moss, dead bindweed. His world was but the circle of his lamp. Progress was slow. He had time.

The Observatory fanned out from a circular drive. Scruffy gravel and brick paths to the seven buildings angled out like hands on a watch. In the center of the circle, a patinated sundial the size of a |débarrasseur|'s tray occupied a fluted chest-height plinth. At seven points around it were planted granite markers. Thirty centimeters square. One meter high. Each carved with the image of a celestial object a Babylonian would recognize: the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

This was the kind of pointless symbology Auguste could do without. Was some calculation on the septo-solar-chronographic apparatus thingy what guided Louis's wanders? Who created it? What did it signify? Who paid for it? Who knows? It was an irrational irritant, much like Louis's erratic behavior.

That night Auguste returned late to the grounds. His man had taken ill. Auguste would man the meridian himself. The astronomical regulator clock would duly be corrected, weather permitting. It was about nine-thirty.

From the road, he saw a shadow in a cone of dim light. Dark but unmistakably Louis. Auguste slowed to a halt about thirty meters away. Louis shambled up to the sundial, leaned heavily, and stared down at it. A long pause. Neither man moved for some time. Unaccountably, Auguste found himself holding his breath, waiting for the pause to end.

At a certain moment, Louis looked up. He turned towards the Chronometry Service building. A building he rarely entered. Slowly he walked to the front door. He let himself in.

||Silly old fool| thought Auguste. Stumbling around in the dark. May he trip over a stool and break his neck. Auguste would not mourn his director's passing. Reaching the circle, Auguste went in the opposite direction from Louis. Soon the windows of Meridian House glowed. The roof gears unlatched with a muffled clunk. If the clouds broke Auguste would be ready.

As Louis ambled towards nine o'clock, relative to the turn-about, and Auguste stepped briskly towards three o'clock, another pair of eyes watched them. Marie paced at her second-floor window. She looked down from the position of ten-thirty.

Marie could not sleep. Most nights, she would stare for hours out the upstairs windows of the director's residence. The fields and hills were a silver negative. They would eventually develop into the confused thoughts of another hot day.

She watched the Meridian roof slowly crack open. She watched Louis's glow enter Chronometry. As it did, Marie clicked a stopwatch. Louis's lamp moved slowly, room to room. Marie listened to clockwork movements ticking in the dark. She counted seconds.

A little later the moon showed briefly. The clouds were breaking. Louis's lamp appeared at the door. He looked up at the moving clouds. His arm moved as if checking his watch. The lamp began moving towards the Equatorial Coudé. It moved more quickly than might have been expected, given its progress before. It moved eagerly.

Marie's watch clicked. Marie let out her breath. Her bedroom door was locked. When finally her eyes closed she reluctantly entered a recurring dream. A dream of a man with a face of skin without flesh, hair without color, eyes without shine, leaning closer and closer, pleading over and over to please just tell him the time.

In the morning Marie woke unrefreshed. The rippling of fowl out back under a rabble of urgent voices on the drive. A man was bellowing. She couldn't disentangle his words. She threw up the sash. Auguste was running from Meridian House. Collar flying. Shoelace untied. Very likely he had been shaving.

"Which of you salaud did this? Someone did, who? Who?!

A big man in a white coat. Beneath that, his shirt ripped open at the neck. He wore the shoes, gloves, and apron of a lab worker. His name was Jerome D'Argens. He operated the ovens, refrigerators, and electrics of the Time Lab. People didn't cross Jerome. It wasn't merely because he was the largest man on campus.

Jerome dashed a trial batch case to the brick path. The top glass shattered. The wooden sides flew apart. A hale of candidate chronometers clattered and bounced. Chronometers were not Observatory property. They were fragile and precious. Jerome was incensed. Associates and apprentices drew back sharply in a widening circle. Arms waved. Eyes wild.

Auguste stumbled and kept running.

Marie froze, her breath shallow. In the study below, Louis's head lay on the table. His temporalis muscle twitched. His arms hung. A house cat startled from a dead bird. Hungry hawks continued circling. Heat menaced the valley.

"This is the third time this month. I will not suffer it! This will not stand!

Jerome kicked the remains of the case. A piece of wood flew at an apprentice's face. Jerome dropped to his knees breathing raggedly. He slammed his fist into the ground. Glass bit into his wrist above the radius. There was blood. It smeared on his pants, sleeves, and his face. It discolored the bricks and grass.

Auguste arrived at his side, gasping.

"Get a doctor! Do it! Now!

To Jerome.

"Come Gerry. Get up man.

He hauled the big man roughly to his feet, nearly toppling over from the effort. At the risk of crushing his boss, Jerome rallied a bit. He leaned on Auguste. They lurched bleeding into Chronometry. Someone began picking up the remains of the chronometers. Soon enough Marie and a broom appeared. The others dispersed.

Marie pointed to Meridian House. The young man picking up scattered chronometers was distracted. She took two of the instruments. One from his hands. One from the ground. He was speaking. She pointed again. The watches went into her apron. She retreated to the director's residence.

Louis's breath was heavy in the study. Marie quietly locked the door. In the kitchen she lay the stolen watches on the butcher block. Scratched but otherwise whole. Beside them, she opened a notebook and flipped to a bookmark. She unbuttoned her high-collared blouse. Pulled her stopwatch chain over her head and laid it beside the book.

Marie's stopwatch was itself a chronometer. On its gold back, the viper marque. Marie corrected it daily. Its complications included a recording chronograph. The time recorded was twenty-six minutes, thirty-one seconds, and three-tenths of a second.

That was the amount of time, to a good approximation, that Louis had spent in the Chronometry Service building. It had been between ten fifty-one and eleven seventeen at night. The rescued chronometers were sixty-two and sixty-eight minutes fast. They had run at about three hundred percent.

Marie shivered. She wrote notes. She calculated. She put her watch chain back around her neck. After a pause, Marie's eyes focused. She stowed the book and abused devices.

Then Marie tiptoed to the study door. She put an ear to the wood. Nothing. Quickly she tied a bonnet and left the house. Walkways swept. Case fragments gone. No observers were out on the grounds.

She quickly walked to the center of the circle. Stalked through the ring of seven stones. Slowly stepped to the dais. Her head bent as if reluctant. She looked down at the copper dial. There was little left of it. Seven ragged bolts stuck out of discolored stone. Blue-green flakes. A pitted ring of paper-thick metal. The barest stub of a gnomon.

Marie gasped, breathed phlegm, and choked. Her notebook dropped. She backed insensibly away. It was far worse than she had expected. So much corrosion of thick raw copper would take not merely centuries, but untold millennia.

Worse, in the stone was a row of five clear indentations. They swam in her vision. She knew what nobody else could know: for a few brief moments, Louis's hand had rested on that stone. That night Louis's hand had been heavier than time.

She calculated furiously as she ran for the house. At the door she paused, and shuddered, her eyes rolling involuntarily. Running up the stairs as quietly as possible. Into her bedroom. She locked the door. Pulled the curtains. Yanked open the closet. Crouched hidden in the stifling dark. Peering out from amongst boxes and shoes. She shook uncontrollably.

Later, when sense returned, she found a gun in her hand. Was it loaded?

The thing locked in the dim study below was a horror beyond time. Something had to be done. The time had come. She whispered to herself.

"It has to be now.

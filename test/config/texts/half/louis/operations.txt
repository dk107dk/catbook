In due course, the Observatory was built. The cornerstone was laid in 1883. By 1885 the buildings were notionally complete. However, setbacks. Unexpectedly, Louis required vast corrective work undertaken.

Workmen were fired. Construction firms dismissed. The remediations moved at a frantic pace. Louis scrutinized every detail. He became a consummate autodidact of architecture, geotechnics, and materials. He supervised with an iron hand. Corrections continued until 1889, more than twice as long as the initial construction.

In a feat of administrative legerdemain, monies were quietly replenished from sources obscure. Not having the full picture, the counting rooms of Paris were content with the reports. Local tradesmen were not complaining about the additional income. Councilmen, the mayor, and the dean were blithely enthusiastic. Everyone wanted the prestige of a local observatory built to rival Kew and Neuchâtel.

The Chronometry Service was practical. Its practicality recommended prompt commissioning. The early start of operations would ease financial concerns about the lengthy retrofits to the astronomy facilities. To that end, Louis focused first on the Lunette Meridian House, home of the Meridian Bezel. The Bezel manufactured time by measuring the motions of the stars. Construction was completed two years before the remainder of the observatory buildings.

Louis lived prior to quartz and atomic timekeeping. Maintaining accurate time required the sighting of cataloged stars. The Bezel was mounted with high precision and limited range of motion. It swept out a narrow band of sky north to the pole star. Stars crossed it with exactitude. Their transits were used to set the Chronometry Service's astronomical regulator clock.

Periodically the regulator was used to set a hack chronometer. An assistant carried the hack to the telegraph room to transmit the time. From that telegraph signal, receivers could correct their own reference clocks. This process occurred nightly around the world. Without it, the natural decay in the running correctness of clocks, watches, and chronometers would soon make time an approximate concept. Ships would founder, military operations would fail, financial markets would melt down.

The secondary activity of the Chronometry Service was the testing of chronographs. The watchmakers of Besançon – all fifteen thousand of them – were in a death match. They faced Geneva, Clerkenwell, and Waltham, Massachusetts, so-called Watch City USA.

Each locale took its own strategy. Waltham mass manufactured quality. The watchmakers of Waltham applied interchangeable parts and automation. The so-called Armory Production System. They could not be undercut. Geneva, instead, focused on superb design, bullet-proof construction, and sophisticated complications. Besançon intended to bind high fashion to astronomical precision. Precision was the |sine qua non| of the competition.

Louis and Auguste were determined that Besançon be the mark of quality. The simple goal echoed the efforts of a small number of elite European time observatories. Auguste's department would build the capability to stress test chronographs using gravity, temperature, and magnetism. Those pieces that passed would be certified by the Observatory and marketed as such.

The testing regime had four tiers. The most expensive was for marine chronometers. These would be mounted in nautical gimbals for their tests. The First through Third-tier certifications were for pocket chronometers. Not every chronometer achieved certification. Far from it. Auguste's technicians were exacting and inflexible. Many pieces left the observatory unrated. Attached, an inglorious description of their deficits.

Its purpose parochial, the Observatory required manufacturers, no matter where domiciled, to use an agent in the city. Agents delivered pieces Monday mornings. They registered important facts. The number of chronometers deposited. The trials each would suffer. Construction details, not limited to escapement, balance, fusée, jewel bearings, and complications. Trials were ten francs per piece.

The proceeds were significant. Chronometers arrived in the lab week by week. Each year, the income grew. The reliable revenue paid for much. Rich paper and packaging, testing equipment, senior staff and their associates, buildings and grounds, and more. All that obtained, the residual was siphoned off to the Astronomy Department to buy grander instruments. This "astronomy tax" stressed the springs and gears between Louis and Auguste.

Nevertheless, the Chronometry Service was a success. Manufacturing increased. Besançon prospered. The reputation of the Observatory grew. Not long after operations commenced Louis decided it was time. The certification process deserved a marque of quality that would be recognized worldwide as the symbol of French timepiece excellence. It would be stamped on letterhead, watermarked in the rating papers, and sealed in wax.

Soon, it became the requirement that manufacturers engrave the backplates of First-class timepieces. First year associates learned the art at |les Écoles Nationales d’Horlogerie de Besançon|. The marque padded the Observatory's coffers and burnished its name.

And the marque Louis chose? He chose a viper. Of course he did.

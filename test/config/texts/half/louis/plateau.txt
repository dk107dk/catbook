>1882 - 1902 - Louis builds an observatory in Besançon

Hundreds of kilometers east of Manchester stood an older city. Born Gaulish, it was taken by Rome, stood proud as a Free Imperial City, became Spanish by marriage, and finally was conquered by France. Eventually the |longue durée| reached a lull in the fighting. For a time, Besançon found peace.

With peace came prosperity through trade, knowledge, and industry. As it happened, the skill that modernized the city was the mechanization of time. In time, Besançon flew the flag of French watchmaking. Competition was fierce. Swiss, German, British, and American watchmakers were relentless. Besançon's artisans required ever greater precision. Precision was found in the predictable movements of the stars.

"
One day in the 1880s, |le Directeur de l'Observatoire de Besançon| stepped heavily to the platform. The way he did it, he might have been squashing a bug. His eyes went to the ordinate clock in green, black, and gold on a flouted pole overseeing the station. It judged the timeliness of the activity happening before it impassively. Unlike |Monsieur le directeur|, it was locally made, and it neither lost nor gained a significant number of seconds each day.

Louis Jules Gruey, a moderately well-known astronomer, had been glad to return to French soil. He checked his pocket watch against the station clock. They were as alike in reading as could be made out at the distance. He had arrived home with certainty. It was time the hard work of building an institution was begun.

Louis had visited the observatories of London at Kew and Greenwich. Across the Atlantic, he had toured the United States Naval Observatory in the charmingly named Foggy Bottom. From there north to the Harvard Observatory, in Cambridge Massachusetts. In Cambridge also, the offices of Alvan Clark & Sons, world-renowned refractor opticians.

Returning to Europe, Louis paid visits to the observatories in Neuchâtel and Lyon. Then finally back to Besançon. In all, ten centers of astronomy and horology, among related interludes. Not every stop was fruitful. The Swiss |Bureaux officiels de contrôle de la marche des montres| had been particularly of interest. Their director, particularly uninterested in helping the next-door French competition. Regardless, the sky was certainly blue. The platform's puddles, drying. It had been a long trip. He was home.

For Louis, the early days at Besançon were energizing. Bootstrapping an observatory essential to the watchmaking industry required considerable funds that industry was not tripping over itself to provide. It was a bureaucratic tangle. Local officials, unions, university trustees, taxpayers, and the various directors of |l'Académie des sciences| in Paris. All saw the observatory through their own lenses. Every franc and every signature required a twist. Louis delivered it with a genial smile.

Slowly there was progress. And in the process Louis's abilities were fully tapped. His ambitions finally raised. Success was within his reach. Day by day his professional preoccupations crept closer.

Louis's wife, Marie Lucie, née Mochot, was less sanguine. Marie was an anxious sort. When left on her own, even more so. With Louis away or held over in town till all hours, Marie was much of the time rattling around in an empty house. She had not built local connections. Marie was not naturally social. Her social calendar was therefore empty.

The couple had no children. No nurse. No servants. Help was an expense that would have stressed the household finances. That might have compromised her husband's ability to project success among the gentlemen his projects depended on. And so, Marie was most often alone. Stress fractures were internalized. She paced before the windows on the second floor. She twisted on the curtains till the hems frayed.

That day in 1882, arriving home, stepping down on the platform, looking up at the clock, Louis returning was not the same Louis that had left. He had been on the hunt for any iota of leverage for the burgeoning watchmaking industry of Besançon. In Switzerland he surreptitiously palmed documents. In Germany, he paid an assistant astronomer to copy designs of bespoke star tracking and astrophotography apparatus. Above all, in Belgium, he met with a blind old man named Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau.

Plateau had lost his sight years before. He lost it to unwise medical experiments of the retina. The experimental subject was him. The procedure had involving staring at the sun. His goal was to characterize the motion of the glowing trails of light imprinted on the backs of his eyes during his observations. He had been considered, if not a genius, at least a very bright man.

That fine day, Plateau had stood on his fourth-floor balcony high over the River Scheldt. He pressed the button on his stopwatch. Tipped his face up to heaven. One eye open, one covered. Plateau poured molten gold into his eye socket. The aqueous humour boiled. His flesh burned. He felt damage. He screamed inside as he counted down the seconds.

Then in a gasping rush, he stumbled into the dark. Felt his way into the washroom. There, behind blackout shades, he attempted metrological operations using auto-ophthalmoscopy effected by way of a guy-wired surgical mirror, steel forceps, and paraffin lamps. He never fully recovered.

The 1800s were like that. On the one hand, everything took forever. Hot lead typesetting. Slow rolling stock on imprecise bearings. The tap-tapping telegraph. Horses and carts and two-cylinder engines. On the other hand, the world was in a tumult that would make a Yorkshire Terrier take a step back.

Instruments and ideas were exploding. Mathematics, mycobacterium, and superalloy metallurgy. Misguided experiments running roughshod over personal safety. The fabric of reality interrogated as to the ultimate end of history.

And Plateau had a special claim on the fabric of reality. With the help of an innovation. A tour de force of his early academic years, more recently reduced to a parlor trick. A blind man's parlor trick was all it took to break Louis Gruey. And that singularly unnoted achievement ultimately had consequences.

In the dim salon where his dead wife had read philosophy to him, Plateau spun a pair of dials the size of small dartboards mounted on a handle. Behind him, a tall gilt-framed mirror skinned in dust, smoke, cobwebs, and the fine spray of fresh fruit, long dried. The air was freighted with unwashed cotton batting, Turkish grounds, and pipe tobacco. The rug was crusty.

The disks he could no longer see were a philosophical toy of his own invention. The |Phénakisticope|. His creation had briefly been the talk of Paris and London. As a young man, he had dimmed the lights in Marble Hall as he lectured Royal Society Fellows on the fragility of perception. When his arc light projected through the spinning translucent disks Plateau strained to be heard above the amazement.

That was then. Over time, the light had shifted to newer artifacts of luminescent philosophical magic. Zoetrope, Thaumatrope, Zoopraxiscope. Plateau, having seen the animated dawn, settled into a long darkening twilight.

Louis’s eyes were pulled into the disks as they spun in Plateau's hands. His visit had been instigated by a compelling young selenographer at the Neuchâtel Observatory. The young man had whispered in Louis’s ear when none were looking. His mysterious instructions were to visit these rooms at midday. Louis was to see Plateau alone. He must not say who sent him. Only observe the mysterious disk and draw his own conclusions. Knowing not what to think, Louis entered Plateau's rooms bemused.

Louis peered into Plateau’s dim world. Plateau’s hands shook. Blue veins under blotched wax paper. The disk Plateau held was plain. It had slots cut in regular intervals, like the numerals on a clock. Sepia-toned. Faint water damage. It turned. Behind it, the second disk turned on the same axle. It rotated independently. The axle was mounted to an ordinate brass and ivory handle, much worn. About fifteen centimeters separated the disks.

Plateau waved Louis closer. On the second disk's turning face were painted sequences of vipers. Louis peered through the spinning wheel of slits at the spinning wheel of snakes.

As he watched, grotesque serpents crawled up from the center and over the side. They danced in a mouth-to-tail |faire la chenille|. Over and over they escaped at the edges. Black, green, red. Dozens of them. The old man's sightless stare bored into Louis through burnt lenses. The disk spun. Louis's skin crawled. Vipers crept up the mirror.

On the platform of Besançon Station, the clock hands moved. Louis found he now observed everything that rotated in the light of the |Phénakisticope|. The great green railway clock clicked forward slowly as he drifted. Lines angled out in numerals. Lines angled out in ticking hands. Snakes slithered up the post. Louis shook his head. His head appeared to be on the platform at Besançon. In reality, it was still lost in a dim apartment in Ghent.

Louis still heard the old man insisting he look closer. What did he see? How did it make him feel?

The thin voice telling him to consider a child huddled in a wagon. He looks out from under a rug. The cart shakes him. The child's vision is jumpy and blurred. He sees little. Suddenly, the child jumps up. Still, the cart shakes but the child sees the world smoothly. What has changed? The persistence of vision smooths the rutted road. And what does the child see? He sees only the ghost of the past.

"Our vision is a dream.

The old man had rasped.

"The world we see is what has been, not what is.

The wheel speeds up. The snakes crawl faster. It speeds up more. The snakes slow and crawl backwards. They vanish into the center.

"Look!

Plateau pointed to the rotating disk.

"Your whole life is here. The strobe-lit tick-tock of le Souverain de Toutes Choses!

His voice remembered tears.

"What change in speed would make the Sun crawl West to East?

The old man's mind careened. Could his wife, his sight, and his eminence in the philosophical life return? Could the wheel of time speed up exactly that crucial amount? Would wagon wheels spin backward in the street? When the animation runs in reverse, does life still move forward?

"Mais, qui est plus aveugle que l'homme qui regarde en arrière?

Plateau strained to project confused thoughts to the man he couldn't see and didn't know. Vipers slithered up his legs. He spun the |Phénakisticope| faster. His chin jerked. He fell back in his chair, exhausted.

Shortly after, Louis left Plateau sleeping fitfully. He went by hansom straight to Ghent station. He wondered. Was everything really just an animation? The syncopation of the second hand? The iron wheels spun. Smoke blurred his eyes. |Le contrôleur a poinçonné les billets lentement.| The wheels turned faster. Louis felt vipers crawling up his spine. They whispered sibilantly to him.

"Your world exists, as such, only by the grace of time.

In time Louis slept. Besançon crept closer. In his dreams, he was already there. Lying under the great refractor. Searching the wheel of the heavens for the spinning slits of time.

By the time Louis mounted the porch of the director's residence his shoes were glued to his feet and his internal clock completely unwound. He and Marie stiffly embraced. A peck on the cheek. Few and rote words. His bags would follow. There was food.

Marie was past full rationality. She had long hidden the |incubation de la folie|. It stemmed from a powerful inner life of neurodivergence and unusual talents. Louis did not know this. Sadly, his professional powers of observation were not employed at home.

With Louis gone, Marie had begun to mold her own relationship with time. Increasingly, her thoughts did not align with Louis's. Interestingly, by some hand-wavy metric, the two of them could have been assessed to have been equally far gone. Time apart had led them to opposite ends of the same deep valley of ticking echoes and temporal fog. Intrepidly, each plunged in.

Louis had left for his second chronological reconnaissance in late winter. That cold spring Marie had a hard time. Never a sunny disposition, she was already at a low ebb. The empty house was not truly theirs. The clock ticked ever louder. Days passed ever more slowly. The crutch of routine was fully unscrewed by the tail end of February. The crutch would soon collapse. She needed something to do, desperately.

The Observatory did not yet exist at that time. It was to be built on several acres three kilometers from downtown on a lane that would later be called |la Rue de l'Observatoire|. The land surrounded a modest peak, |la Bouloie|. It was the beneficiary of a general rise from the river. The false peak formed an approach to a higher crest to the west topped by |le Fort des Montboucons|, the lesser redoubt of the fortifications commanding Besançon. The observatory buildings would stand nine hundred feet above the datum.

Construction had been repeatedly held up. Architectural designs remained unconfirmed. Money, unallocated. University departments were fighting. The craftsmen, preoccupied. The city, apathetic. Louis, overseas.

At Louis's reunion with Marie, little existed. A lane from the university's outermost buildings, a path from lane to a dirt half-circle, and an ancient two-story farmhouse. The house had been earmarked as a residence put at the disposal of the director. It had been spruced up a bit. Louis would occupy it till the day he died.

"
The evening before Louis left Besançon on his second peregrination the Dean of Besançon University hosted an intimate formal dinner. The narrow stone townhouse glowed. Candles projected the shadows of tiny bubbles on the snow. A single cell animation of frozen time. Inside, warm wood paneling. |Poulet à la comtoise| and |saucisse de morteau|. Sweet wine and ingratiating conversation.

The Dean introduced Marie to a young man. Auguste Hrique was a university associate in maths. New to town but not unknown. He was angling to transition to Assistant Chronometer. Success seemed likely. As such, Auguste would head the yet-to-be-built observatory's Chronometry Service.

Auguste was grand-nephew to Louis Saint-Loup. Old Saint-Loup was |Chaire de Mathématiques Appliquées| and, of late, on-paper, director of the Besançon Observatory. That Louis Saint-Loup was superseded by Louis Gruey before even the first stone had been laid was the past. No longer of interest to wagging tongues. It can be presumed that it was still of note to Auguste.

At dinner Auguste was of measured tone, sober-minded, and circumspect. He spoke well. Louis was impressed. He was relieved that the associate was a credit to his department, and likely to be so to the Observatory. That would come after what couldn't be avoided was consummated. Politically, Auguste was a requirement. Practically, an unknown ford of uncertain footing. Louis was an optimist. He good-naturedly waded in.

During dinner, the conversation turned to philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. The dean was expansive. He led only about two hundred souls. As such, he was eager for the urbanity visitors from more reputable universities might expect. Auguste gave the dean the impression he had seen it all before. He had not. Marie watched impassively.

Marie had grown to adulthood among a large family steeped in finance, politics, and industry. Her Paris was bright lights reflected off dark hardwood. Banter, understatement, irony, and lace. Arrogance, often wrapped in inconsequential deference. Formal schooling aside, her education had been at the hands of savvy |salonnières|.

Marie knew those who knew things before others did. She knew the facial expressions of those who knew things that others wanted to know, but would not be allowed to. She knew what proper tables did at the beginning, middle, and end. As she aged under that weight of society, she had grown demure and distant. She moved to one side. And off on that quiet side she had calculated.

For in that earlier life, Marie had been groomed to be a computer. She excelled. Her cadre of young women compiled tables of armaments for the Ministry of War. Logistics, trajectory, impact. Together they fought the War of 1870. Though their work had been excellent, in arrears the failed war was not thought a fit topic. She had not been introduced to Louis as such.

Louis never really understood the worlds Marie had lived in, societal or computational. Or that she loved the menial numbers. Or that lowly computer she remained, if only at a remove. Louis's failure to play to Marie's strengths was a significant miscalculation. She might have contributed much. In hindsight, the mistake was probably fatal.

That night, Marie calculated at speed. Her synaptic agility was well beyond provincial dinner chit-chat. Autonomically she tracked frequencies and levels. She quietly explored spaces, orientations, and motions. In her inner world, she was the master of time and space.

When the conversation grew rote she rotated the room slowly. She held the liquids steady as the crystals rolled like cup joints. She pulled an alternate reality around her shoulders comfortably. Marie's astral projection pressed her body firmly into her seat. The other guests were held by unfelt forces as the floor cranked up one hundred and eighty degrees. Twelve feet in the air. Majestic control. Oak crushing Savonnerie. Kinematics overwhelming gravity.

In |soiree| physics some things float. Wisps of gray hair. The scent of African Violets. Vapors of breathing wine. Other things repel. Grains loose in their shakers. Spoons cavitating coffee. Wax spitting off candles. All follow patterns of dynamical forces. Forces gentler than gravity. Waves of social customs. Customs interfering with personal emissions. Pealing, curling, and reflecting off unpredictable surfaces.

And all those lovely words! Letters reduced to digits. An infinite number field. Left outer acrostics. Chronogram. Anagram. Lipogram. |Bouts-Rimés| and echo verse. A syllabotonic adjacency field transformable by high-dimensional matrix into any sense, sensibility, or secret. What was that |le professeur| said? Why, anything you like!

Marie's dreamy eyes spiraled in mind-bending faux proprioception and the distracting power of swirling linguistic manifolds. Her dinner repartee quotient veered dangerously towards supercritical. Pressure built invisibly. She was not at all bored but only by dint of somehow holding it together.

"
Not many weeks later the shy gray-eyed wife of |le directeur| entered the town. She stepped out of the cold March rain into the mathematics department. Auguste immediately recalled Marie sitting across from him at dinner. He remembered the imperceptibly frenetic shivers of her pupils. Sitting quietly as conversation flowed down the table. Her enigmatic disengagement. Her distant social graces. What was behind those eyes?

Could she be of assistance with any dull numeric chores? Why, perhaps she could be. Had she experience in the differential calculus? Yes, she had assisted with such at |Université de Paris|. It had been in preparations for Enrique Gaspar's lectures at the |Exposition Universelle|. She wished to offer whatever she could. She was at a surfeit of time and a loss for occupation. And, though not in so many words, at a loss for meaning.

Auguste was pleased to accept.

And that was how it happened. Marie became an adjunct to Auguste's philosophical investigations. Time-frequency metrology. Plesiochronous drift. Derivatives describing physical change under physical forces. Magnetism, meteorology, gravity, vibration. Auguste may have had political leverage over his desired appointment. Nevertheless, he was taking his preparations to lead the Chronometry Service determinedly. He would be neither denied nor unprepared. She would help.

"What is this thing?

Marie held up a glass plate, about thirty by twenty centimeters. It looked smoked and pitted. There were red and black grease pen marks. Arrows. Numbers.

"Gélatine négatif. The dry plate process. Silver salts suspended in a gelatin binder.

Auguste had his technical face on. He had been working a lab bench with a slide rule, springs, wires, and other things. Who knows what?

"Oui, très bien, but what is it? And can all of them live elsewhere?

Marie looked at the plate covered in soot and cobwebs. She blew the dust.

"Those are Caillasse's. Cai is learning to photograph. That smudge is purported to be an astronomical body. But he's just driving blind. If he crashes into a market, the horse eats. If he crashes into a restaurant, he eats. If he runs into the river, he avoids washing the cart.

Marie didn't follow about horses and restaurants. She was peering at the negative image from a few centimeters away.

"How does it work? Can anyone do it? Cai sure has a lot of these. Is it expensive?

Auguste gestured to a box shape under a canvas, a tripod, stands, and crates in the corner.

"There's a lot of equipment. It takes some learning. I made one of those.

Marie was going through them one by one. Auguste came over to her bench.

"Cai has a small pile of francs from a patron that has a thing for scientists.

Marie had her lost-in-inner-calculations voice handy.

"What would you do with it?

Auguste's voice did a very slight timber shift. He began talking about something he wasn't entirely sure of. Auguste preferred certainty.

"Well, once the observatory is up. Once I'm running chronometry. We will certify chronometers. And I think we might use dry plate in the testing process.

Marie was attentive.

"I thought maybe we could make a visual record of observations. That might attract the manufacturers. Who knows? Perhaps even raise the precision of our measurements? That could be an important result.

His eyes dropped.

"But I haven't figured it all out. It is just an idea.

Marie watched Auguste closely. She wanted to encourage him. He didn't smile much. She liked it when he did.

"I could mention it to Louis when he returns. Would that help?

Auguste straightened. He returned to his former position. His lamps, springs, and slide rule. His voice became controlled.

"No need. When the time comes I'll talk with him. When I'm ready.

Marie's face was frozen. She continued to pick glass plates out of the box. She knew then she would drop at least one of them. Intentionally. It didn't matter which. She would do it just to see a moment in time shatter on the floor. But she would wait. She would do it when she was alone.

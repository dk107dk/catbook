The day Doctor B. sent Phaeton into harm's way dawned bright and clear. Phaeton fell into the daylight as he was descending the spiral stairs from the observatory at Sackville Street. It was a nice bit of celestial choreography.

Phaeton had reached the familiar stair rail. Dulled by lack of sleep, he misjudged. The top riser's front plate was a nailhead higher than expected. A hitherto unknown wear-smoothed three-millimeter-wielding burr found his palm. Sunlight off the chimney flashing dazzled him through the window. Off balance, his reflex arcs snapped to attention.

The second riser had accumulated a sheen suspiciously like bacon sarnie. Phaeton’s awkwardly thrust heal glanced off. His left hand was too busy rubbing his eyes to compensate effectively. Before his brain could analyze how badly his grab had failed, most of his body had already managed to get itself airborne. Even within the rigid confines of the stairs' iron helix, there was plenty of room.

So much motion! He descended sharply sinister, even as his right arm leaped in counterpoint. His anteroposterior axis gimballed fluidly. His transverse plane carved a tangent to the spiral rail. Briefly, his longitudinal axis revolved dead-on to the North Star.

At that instant – books in air, feet in air, arms wild, surprised face – Phaeton realized that if he swung his right arm up and back just a bit further than his discombobulated physics were forcing it to, he would be pointing directly at the Big Dipper. In that pose, he would thereby have a fair chance of calculating how late he was to unlock Lovell's office for fresher's office hours by noting which spiral stair tread his head collided with on the way down.

Phaeton weaved tiredly through the Astronomy Department's power electronics lab with a neon-red line across his forehead. Shortly after, he unlocked Lovell's office, a few minutes late. He raised the door shade. The calcified electric teapot sputtered.

"Aten, you look a little wobbly this fine morning. Lose your lunch money to the bloke who did you that stripe?

Austen Piper was an upperclassman with a jolly tone that belied his brilliance. Piper called Phaeton Aten like everyone else in the department did because, well, the solar reference was perfect. Others called him that because it’s hard to watch the stars when the sun is out. The different genders of the department’s aspiring astronomers saw the humor differently. Phaeton mumbled something and promptly knocked his knee on a workbench.

"Aouugh, bloody hell and bother!

Piper was amused at the degree to which Phaeton was not.

"On the other hand, I achieved a result! Did you know that under certain experimental conditions the stairs to the observatory, with only a smidgen of eigenvector matrix manipulation, can be used as a nocturne to estimate how late you are in leaving the observatory?

Considering the questionable quality of his audience, Phaeton quickly qualified.

"That is, assuming you know you know your stars and are quick with the calculations on the way down.

Piper would have been hysterical had he not already thought of that method.

"Yes, naturally. But is it worth the landing? I mean, wristwatches are so much more convenient in these modern times.

Phaeton didn’t have a ready rejoinder. Piper had a point.

Phaeton spent the night that ended questionably in Godlee Observatory's |papier-mâché| dome. He not infrequently spent clear nights motionless under the optical telescopes. Phaeton’s beauty was the three-hundred-millimeter Newtonian reflecting telescope. While not of world-class size, it was large enough to enable flashes of extra-solar system brilliance, atmospheric dispersion, and turbulence allowing.

Phaeton's use of observatory time was unconventional. Competition for the space was modest. He could easily block off whole nights. The city dimmed by eleven. Ensconced in position, Phaeton would, more often than not, limit himself to a single unlit speck of sky. He would peer into his dark target for a prolonged time. Often the whole night. Stars and nebula sliding along the liminal ocular margin barely registered. Phaeton would lie implacably still sinking into the deep field.

"Young Helios Hierarch, you are here.

Doctor B. was the only one who spun Phaeton's mythical name, sacred pharaonic nickname, and Gaelic surname into this kind of abstruse humor. It was funny to no one else. At this point, you should be realizing that for some reason Phaeton generated a warm molecular cloud of geeky humor around him, from which goofy mots constantly condensed into unstable signals, often missed. For Phaeton, none of it really focused. He was busy becoming an astronomer, so of course it didn't.

"The tea is on. Your latest journals and correspondence are in the tray. So far, no pups observed queuing up for instrument time.

Lovell appreciated it. He was slowly losing the ability to function without Phaethon's assistance. And office hours with no students was a thing treasured.

"Where'd that mark come from?

The professor indicated Phaeton's forehead.

"I was studying transient motions in cylindrical coordinate systems.

Lovell looked skeptical.

"The stairs at Godlee?

Phaeton affirmed it with a complex nose-scrunching, head-nodding shrug. He stifled a yawn.

"What did you observe?

Phaeton was momentarily confused.

"About the circum-transitive regression function?

Lovell snorted genially.

"Oh, what was I observing?

Lovell thought his question obvious. Spatial matrix transformations were, at Phaeton's level, remedial. Not worth investigating.

"I'm not sure. I guess... well…

Phaeton sounded tired. To Lovell, this sounded like another so-called deep field experiment. They were increasingly concerning. He had seen this fervor of staring for hours at nothing before. It hadn't ended well. A bright lad ended in a fatal fall from the highest clock tower in Manchester. It had happened only a few years prior. The dean and doctors called it mental exhaustion. Lovell wouldn't argue the point. He had put it behind him. And yet, he worried.

"Look here, you want sleep. Go home. Not even heartbroken thirds are coming to office hours this close to summer. I'll have a quiet morning catching up.

Phaeton tried not to look enthusiastic at the idea of sleep. Unfortunately, that effort just came across as knackered. Precisely to Lovell's point.

"You are still obsessing over the deep field, yes? Have we not talked about that? The futility, given the equipment available? And that on fellowship it could be seen as a poor use of time?

Phaeton agreed that they had.

"Get out of here. Go sleep it off. And if you don't want me questioning your design of experiments and life choices, consider more illuminating objects. For example, I hear radio astronomy is very nice.

Lovell looked cartoonishly severe in a very intentional way.

"Out.
Phaeton mumbled thanks. He rubbed his forehead, grabbed his cap and books, and beat an orderly retreat.

As Phaeton's steps clattered down the hall, Lovell enlisted a pen, paper, and Smith Corona. He thought a few moments. Then he wrote a short note to Philippe Messier, master astronomer, at the Besançon Observatory. Lovell tucked the letter in an envelope. With it, a recent paper of Phaeton's. A good one.

Pressing the intercom, Lovell called for the department secretary. He sent the letter. He also asked that she deliver to him the ledger of department research grant funds available. On inspection, two months in cheap lodging, eating baguettes, and taking fourth-class carriages seemed affordable. Phaeton was worth it.

Lovell had no idea how much trouble his kindness and concern would make for the lad.

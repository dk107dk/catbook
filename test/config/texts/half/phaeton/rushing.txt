>1951 - Phaeton on the last train to Besançon

The train ran off new-laid Parisian steel onto rusted joggled joints holding provincial pre-war rails together long past depreciation. A crashing beat rose as the tempo dropped. Steel wheels battered. Trucks groaned. Phaeton Athair woke in a dim world with everything in motion.

Farmhouses lights transformed into distant stars and galaxies. They flashed under the gray reflection of the inside of the carriage. Track signals transformed into meteors. Delivery van headlights became nebula, winking into and out of existence in time to the thumping trucks.

The undulating land was a grand vista, dark with lonely fireflies. In the foreground, fieldstone walls, brush, fences, and occasional trees flitted by in a present too rushed to be remembered. And in front of that blur, the staid reflections of dim lights, wood trim, dingy cloth seats, and the infinitely gray kaleidoscope of windows facing windows.

He had no idea where he was. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't wake. The train rushed him towards a destination well east of anywhere he had expected in life to be.

In less than four hours Phaeton would be in Besançon.

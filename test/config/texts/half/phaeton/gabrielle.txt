Gabrielle Renaudot Flammarion had spent the war outside. She swept mounds of glass and aluminum micrometeorites, spent cartridges, and brick fragments off the roof walk of the observatory. Juvisy-sur-Orge had been a key rail logistics hub. Every night Gabrielle's ostensible allies flew overhead. They stopped throwing bombs at her only when the density of bomb craters was such that no untouched ground could fit a railcar. The city had been largely erased from around her.

And yet, there she had been, dawn after dawn. Sweeping away a deep snow of detritus. After a year, her roof walk was the longest promenade in town. Her equatorial dome, the highest spire. The walled grounds, a wildlife refugee camp where sparrows, pigeons, and kestrels cohabited uncomfortably. At last, the sirens stopped. There were no more fires. Everything was gone. The bombers shouldered brusquely by the beggars below not looking them in the eye.

Ferdinand Quénisset stepped carefully onto the roof walk tiles. He looked over the rebuilt town slowly growing outside the walls.

"Dear, what is Odette on about? She has the yeux de folle. She's rushing about breaking things.

Gabrielle continued to stare over the town. She looked up towards where |Pont des Belles-Fontaines| bridged the Orge. The fountain statuary of Time struggling with Discord. She felt it coming. It would come that way.

"Fergie, we are at a confluence. This is what Camille prepared us for. One who is taken by the primum movens and pursued by les Défenseurs.

Ferdinand sighed. The sigh was a complex statement. It combined exhaustion, resignation, recognition, and acknowledgment of his need to revivify. She had, in fact, signaled the calumniation of a watch they had stood for decades. Never knowing if they would be called. Now they had been. It was time.

"I'll make the coffee.

He turned and left the roof. This time he stepped carefully, intentionally not relying on his cane.

In the kitchen Odette Connes was braying at the cook, talking animatedly on the hall phone, and tapping her watch. She was marshal of the household and looked it. Ferdinand could wait. Interrupting was possible. Odette's powers of multitasking were prodigious. However, it was like to result in a tongue lashing as in the desired effect.

The household and observatory staff was small. The cook was an astrophysicist of note. Her |Galette De Rois| was legendary. She had published on it. The groundskeeper investigated astronomical seeing and what would in the future be known as adaptive optics, between bouts of topiary maze making and |celastraceae| wrangling. Day hands showed up and disappeared as required by Odette. Gabrielle gave younger academics |ad hoc| fellowships, as the mood struck her. It was an environment erudite and familial.

"We are shutting the gates and would ask you to help minimize passing traffic, if possible. There may be flashes of light from photographic equipment.

Ferdinand puttered around the cabinets trying to stay out of the way. He found aged Madagascar vanilla beans in a large specimen jar. Kenyan coffee in burlap bags. From a drawer filled with junk, he pulled gears and a handle. Another drawer yielded a three-point vice, ring stand, and sundry hardware. A high cupboard hid the glassware. He extracted a calcium-spotted beaker, graduated cylinder, and filter funnel. Several brow-furrowing minutes later a bespoke coffee grinder was mounted over a beaker perched on a concentric ring tripod with a lab burner flaring underneath. His goggles fogged.

Odette took a cup without pausing her latest call, apparently to the local airfield. Ferdinand headed back to the roof with two mugs. The cane was abandoned. It wasn't missed. He didn't fall. Just the opposite, he was walking as if having woken up. It was time.

Waiting for her coffee, Gabrielle rehearsed the plan. The young man would arrive at the side wall. Up from the river. Presumably on foot. Would he know his destination? Too soon to say. The groundskeeper, Rabaha Zayani, an optical physicist from Brazil, would find him and get him safely over the glass-sharded top. With luck, their British contact would have arrived. The sooner they whisked the runner to a plane and away the better. She didn't care where.

If all went well, they would have done their job. The one they had been watching and waiting for so long. If all went sideways, well, who could say? The risks were great. Life and limb were nothing compared.

God, she needed coffee. Happily, she foresaw its arrival.

"Are we on track, Estella?

Gabrielle turned to take her mug. She looked at Ferdinand appraisingly. He appeared decades younger than before going downstairs. Must be some coffee, she said wryly in her most ironic internal voice.

"Yes. The timing is tight. Is Odette ready?

Ferdinand shrugged almost imperceptibly as if to say:

"You know as well as I.

And, at the same time:

"You already know what I think so why ask?

He appreciated being asked. She appreciated him being there. They watched the horizon together. The coffee was good.

"
At Juvisy-sur-Orge Sûreté station Constable Henri Blum did not have coffee. He regretted the fact. It pained him. The night was young.

"Hé, Bernard, grab your hat. The spaceshots are up to something tonight. They want us to close Rue de l'Observatoire.

Bernard Boulanger was Blum's out-of-shape partner. His hat was dented. Blum sometimes wished his partner was more of a go-getter. On the other hand, he was a personality that was easy to like, so that helped.

"They can do that?

Blum looked skeptical.

"They can ask. Anyone can ask, so they tell me.

Boulanger hadn't yet resigned himself to leaving the building to do anything with his partner in the cold and dark.

"Where are you going? Why not just say no? Or say yes but do nothing. Nobody goes down there at night, anyway. It's just a back way between the three parks.

Blum's skepticism morphed to annoyance. The truth was, he was curious and just wanted to get out and have a look about.

"Lazy dog, wake up, and let's go. We're going to have a look. Maybe we'll get to do something exciting. Like telling them to stop being weird menaces to peace and quiet.

His partner was reluctantly in motion.

"Oh, that sounds fun then. Shall I bring my shotgun?

Blum was already halfway out the door. Heading to their Renault 4CV. He didn't think Boulanger needed the shotgun. He would regret that very reasonable decision shortly.

"
Phaeton was regretting many things. He was huddled under the lower center span of |Pont des Belles-Fontaines|. The crossing was point-eight kilometers from where Gabrielle stood. The space echoed with a delicate purl of drops plucked from the walls by gentle condensation-driven convection. He was cold.

The day had been unusually difficult. Hunger. He had stolen two rolls from the back of a baker. An employee saw him. He had to run. He fell down the bank of the Orge. The rolls were covered in dark mud and soaked. He ate them anyway. That was all he had had to eat in eighteen hours.

||Pont des Belles-Fontaines| was a functional monument. In the best French style, it was not entirely of this world. By comparison to the massive wrought-iron towers, colossal order salt factories, and imperious triumphal arches of France, the towering stone fountains topping an elaborate architectural substructure enabling farmers to get from one muddy bank ten meters distant from the other lay in quiet modesty. Designed by an eccentric to impress an autocrat. Paid for by an entire country of Frenchmen.

The Orge became channelized. A rampart approach had been erected to carry the highway from Paris to Fontainebleau through Juvisy. At the crossing, it stretched north as a grand cobbled tree-lined boulevard. The |Pont| was framed by two stone statues. One of a rampant depiction of Old Man Time. The other, a more abstract assemblage. At the base of each, spring-fed water spit out of carnival grotesques. It poured into troughs, overflowed, and seeped into the superstructure to drip into mist.

The substructure below was formed as a great arched bridge thrown over seven lesser bridges. The thirty-five-meter-long channel progressively constricted as if to raise and speed the water. It flowed through seven massive fourteen-meter span, eight-meter tall limestone arches. Each was only wide enough to serve as a foot or bicycle path. And each led from nowhere to nowhere. Over these, a muscular barrel arch raised the road another five meters. This second span was the relatively colossal pedestal of the monumental dromos and its elaborate statuary.

All this, largely hidden by trees and scrub, in service to just the narrow muddy river soon to vanish unremarked into the far greater Seine.

Phaeton stood unsteadily up to his knees in the dim shallows, listening. Shivering. There were no cars for several minutes. He was below |Avenue de la Cour de France|. Close to the Camille Flammarion Observatory. How close? He wasn't sure. Could he run it? Could he run at all? He felt like collapsing against the slippery bridge wall.

Phaeton's eyes closed. He yearned for a future when all this was over. And not for the first time, he pictured Cori with him there in that future, too.

"
On the roads above Phaeton, two cars were prowling. Frère Michel drove one of the cars. He was about a kilometer west of the bridge. The big man hunched over the wheel. Glowering. Alone. He drove slowly. His eyes scanned the side streets, hedges, and paths carefully. The eyes of a watchmaker caught every detail in the search for a trail.

Xavier Droz drove the other car. He was head of the |École Nationale d’Horlogerie de Mécanique d’Électricité|. Like Frère Michel, Droz was long an initiate of |les Défenseurs|. Victor Solomon, a young chronograph technician on his staff, road with him. Each car had an AN/PRC-6 walkie-talkie to communicate. The units had been modified. They thought they could get up to five kilometers. On the other hand, Frère Michel rarely spoke so the expected range was just theoretical.

Xavier and Victor drove their Citroën 2CV up and down |la Cour de France|. They felt sure their quarry would eventually show within eight kilometers of Juvisy-sur-Orge. Frère Michel sectioned the Orge watershed, crisscrossing the highway east to west. His horizontal slices gradually rose from south to north.

How did they know to sweep that ground? In the |gendarmerie| at  Arc-et-Senans the officer at the public desk overheard Phaeton speaking to Lovell. |Beaune| and |Juvisy-sur-Orge|. Phaeton had been careful not to say |Besançon|, |Cori|, |Zélie|, or |observatory|. Nevertheless, his height, nationality, and appearance matched the description. Merely that he was alone didn't dissuade. It had been a risk worth taking and a jolly good try. The desk officer phoned Besançon directly that Phaeton's shadow left his door.

Thierry Hrique, head of the Besançon Observatory Chronometry Service, in turn received a phone call not long after. Within minutes he was back on the road and heading this time in the correct direction. Juvisy-sur-Orge was on the way to Paris. Hrique quickly put himself en route to Beaune and his other two cars between there and Juvisy-sur-Orge.

Hrique's mind repeatedly clicked through the combinations as he drove. Phaeton and the British girl would want to head home. Phaeton had called a famous astronomer for help. Was help coming to them, or was he seeking a retreat back to England? If the former, could they be running for another observatory? There were several within a couple hundred kilometers. Juvisy-sur-Orge had one.

Alternatively, the nondescript suburb could have been mentioned as part of directions to the nearby Villeneuve-Orly airfield. Or perhaps on a route to the Paris Observatory. Hrique acknowledged the possibilities to himself. And what else was he not thinking of? And yet, his gut said help was coming to rendezvous with the trio at Camille Flammarion Observatory. It fit. At Beaune he would check for messages and perhaps learn more.

The thought of the observatory at Juvisy made Hrique's steering choppy. Flammarion he had met once. It had been early in his career. Before he had the weight of knowledge on his shoulders. It had been at the tail end of Flammarion's flamboyant life. The old man had given a talk at his observatory. Hrique couldn't remember exactly. Something to do with the periodicity of comets.

Hrique had then not yet retreated from speculative cosmology. The subject had then still held the fascination of the viper. A dangerously lithe beauty that is all but impossible to catch. He took the trip hoping to meet Georges Lemaître at the event. A talk involving the timing of comets had seemed a safe topic and an excellent opportunity.

Hrique had been in awe of the famous Flammarion. And too, the Belgian priest that had proposed a universe that was exploding. At the same time, Flammarion's reputation for mind-bendingly outrageous notions had made the incrementalist apprentice of astrometric chronometry uneasy. Lemaître's more sober-minded person offered an even more incomprehensible vision. A whole universe exploding from an infinitesimal point. He was almost more terrifying than Flammarion. Nonetheless, Hrique had gone.

That night the talk attracted no more than ten physicists and astronomers, despite Flammarion's fame and showmanship and Lemaître's compelling theories. The night was cold and the rain. The small group listened in Flammarion's equatorial room. High over the ancient river estates that had not yet been destroyed from above. Hrique had no memory of the talk. He had no memory of speaking his mind or asking his questions. He remembered vaguely the shadowy faces in the lamp-lit dome.

What Hrique remembered vividly was Flammarion, at a certain moment, invoking the astonishing dynamical cosmology of Alexander Friedmann. The universe was furiously expanding. It would do ever so until it extinguished itself in an infinite black mist of stillness. Flammarion expounded, lauded, and lionized.

And then, from the shadows, Flammarion reached down. He lifted a round, white shell. Held it high. The skull of Friedmann! The most prescient craniums were meeting that night, he declared. From the inception of |l'Hypothèse de l'Atome Primitif| past the extremity of eternity. He had gestured grandiosely with his other hand from Lemaître's wide eyes to the empty sockets of the grinning skull. Hrique's skin had crawled. He had backed away, slipped down the stairs, and fled the building.

Hrique had later learned Alexander Friedmann had died of typhoid in Crimea only three weeks prior. Flammarion had been a crackpot. Probably a dangerous one. The dangerous children were headed towards his legacy. He was certain of it.

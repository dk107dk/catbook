Philippe was in a fine mood. It was a bright summer Saturday. He was seated at |Le Petit Tableau|, an ancient cafe on |Rue des Granges|. Breakfast was good there. Ten minutes after he was due, Phaeton stumbled in blinking. The bored |serveuse| guided him over.

"Ah, Aten. Come sit down. You look like death warmed over.

Phaeton felt like death warmed over. He was still struggling with the evening before. He looked around nervously and sat. Happily, Philippe had taken a table in a recessed corner, away from the windows.

"So, what are your plans for this fine day?

The Observatory director gestured through the dark oak maze of small tables with chairs upside down on them, through two crooked doorways half a mile to a tiny sliver of daylight passing through the thick stone wall, reflected from the front of the oddly named |Le Pain de la Boulangerie Mystère| across the narrow cobbled street. Phaeton planned to stay out of sight. The cafe was perfect. He needed to regroup, wake up, and find Cori and Zélie. Not necessarily in that order.

To Philippe, |Rien|, nothing much.

"Your work with the astrograph this first week was well done. You have a good eye and steady hands. Lovell is a great teacher, yes?

Phaeton appreciated the kind words.

"In your second week, let's drop the remedial exercises. I'd like you to apply yourself to interferometry. This is why you are here, no?

Phaeton perked up a bit. He had gained a little understanding of what the older man had in mind. It was speculative, fascinating, and so close to the very thing Lovell had sent him to Besançon to get far away from: the deep field. The infinite depths of a patch of empty dark sky. Excellent!

Phaeton ordered Turkish coffee. A double. Told their waitress to keep him full. She looked at him funny. Philippe didn't translate.

"As I have told you, I want to make of the universe an incroyable precision chronometer. You know the basic idea, yes? Find regularly pulsing objects. Fiducial reference points. Use their regular beat to correct the synchronization of distant crystal oscillator clocks for precise amplitude control. Correlate recorded observations over intercontinental distances. Combine them to make an aperture énorme.

Phaeton perked up. He knew that such pulsing objects were barely theoretical. And he assumed that clock synchronization was just the start of the follow-on problems.

"Oui, mais comme vous le savez peut-être. Er, I mean, as you may know, a pulsing star is third-order speculation of many impossibilities.

Philippe counted on his fingers.

"First one must discover the proposed neutron star. It has never been observed. Then one may do an investigation of spin and find magnetism at an unbelievable number of maxwells. An assumption ridicule. Of course, never proved.

One finger for the neutron star. Fingers for spin and magnetism. Nevertheless, Philippe's proposed impossible star is in fact out there. At that time, though, it was still waiting to be discovered.

A neutron star is a post-supernova remnant of a massive star. The cartoon description is this. After fusing its primordial hydrogen into helium, the star progresses to fusing its helium into heavier, larger lithium atoms. That done, it progresses to fuse lithium to the still heavier carbon. And so on and so forth till iron is produced. The iron sinks to form a core. The core becomes so dense its atoms begin collapsing as their structure deforms under their incredible gravity. At a certain point, the residual shell around this hyper-dense core of decomposing atoms is blown off in a supernova. Left behind, a searing, rapidly spinning neutron star.

"Finally, one may look for the pulse radiation the neutron star might emit due to its frenetic spinning and impossibly strong magnetic field. And, if it were found, the question is, would it be regular enough to set your watch by? I believe it would be!

Philippe hit a crescendo and paused.

"Mais Oui, this is merely my raw supposition. Perhaps I am misguided. Many would say so.

Philippe didn't look as modest as his words attempted.

"If we actually found such an impossible star it would needs be perfectly oriented so its beam flashed Earth. A semaphore signal from a distant ship. À la distance parfaite.

Philippe had run out of fingers.

"So many impossible things.

Philippe sighed. Phaeton had found himself hypnotized by the finger count. He shook his head. Applied coffee.

"Is all that even doable?

Philippe gave Phaeton a curious sidelong look.

"Yes, in principle. Probably in the future, in fact.

He understated his certainty. Phaeton missed it because eggs.

"Assuming the stars exist, maybe we can find them. They would have to be regular. Preferably spinning unbelievably fast. On the order of milliseconds. But there is more. That is just the beginning of the correlation problem.

Phaeton had seen at least that coming.

"Once we have the frequency synchronization, then we need the time code. We can mark the time on tape, certainement. But we have to pull the tape through the machine at the correct timing. The consistency is on the order of microseconds. Stability on the order of ten to the tenth. Maybe better. That means a variation of less than a microsecond per day on the frequency punched in the time code. And at least as good, if not better, on the tape feed. This has never been done.

Phaeton just stared. More coffee.

"Mon Dieu, yes?

Philippe was not put out by the challenge. He regarded this interlinked set of puzzles as settled physics law just waiting for enforcement. Meanwhile, if Besançon could enunciate merely a rationale for experiments, that would perhaps be enough to generate significant controversy. With controversy, prestige, funding, resources, and the best minds. New possibilities for Besançon Observatory!

Where did Philippe get his confidence? At least to Phaeton, he probably would have said he saw the future. Can you imagine how he would have smiled as he said it? Phaeton didn't ask. His mood was lifting. Why question it?

"I'm good for three or four impossible things this morning. Where do we start?

Phaeton had not yet seen this particular future. He needed direction.

"You and I will hunt the neutron star. I think it best to say nothing to Lovell.

Phaeton grinned.

"My head of Chronometry, Thierry Hrique, knows the crystal frequency generators. Hrique seems to like the quartz. Even as it prepares to kill the workshops of Besançon.

Philippe frowned briefly. Then continued.

"And I pulled in a young woman who has done work in frequency stabilization of data recording material passed through a clockwork drive. Her name is Zélie Barraqué. You'll meet her. She doesn't yet know she is going to invent the future.

Philippe smiled in a way Phaeton interpreted as indicating he had done something clever.

"You can meet her, well, I guess Monday morning. Unless you'd like to make a start today?

Phaeton absolutely wanted to make a start immediately. He finally had something to say to all this.

"Ha. I think I know Zélie already.

And here Trappist beer and a long evening played tricks on him.

"But I thought her name was de Saulcy?

Philippe looked up sharply. He paused.

"Really? I do not think so.

He looked down.

"Or perhaps I should have seen that coming.

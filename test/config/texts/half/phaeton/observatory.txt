>1951 - The Observatory's secrets

Philippe and Phaeton slipped into the Observatory in a panel van borrowed from a local appliance shop. They delivered a second-hand settee to the Director's Residence. Pinstriped delivery caps on heads. The caps would have matched name-tagged shirts, had they been actual delivery men. All in good fun.

The residence was a spruced up two-story farmhouse, mostly empty. Philippe had been handed the keys with the title Director. Unmarried, he didn't need the space. As a gesture of loyalty, he was slowly accumulating second-hand furniture. Filling the house wouldn't have been a challenge had the director's compensation been commensurate to the title.

Philippe gave a quick tour. He spared Phaeton the dramatic stories grown large with the retelling. Time for that later. They stepped into the sun.

Having delivered the settee in disguise, the director was loose on the grounds. No one was paying attention. The two slipped from the kitchen of the residence to a horse path. The horse path ran around the back of the grounds. It ringed the Equatorial Coudé, the Grand Meridian, the Time Lab, and the other buildings. They minded the nettles. Nobody minded them. They weren't surreptitious. That's just how it happened.

Philippe had gradually precessed from |Apprentissage Horloger| to the top over a long career at the Observatory. Of late, he had gone Astro. Naturally, then, to the Coudé. The former home of the Besançon Equatorial Coudé was the next building clockwise. Graceful and ornate. It rose two and a half floors in front, three and half in the back, facing the valley. It had an excellent view of the universe.

An equatorial coudé is a rare instrument of French design. It is a bent refractor. Which is to say, an equatorial telescope with an elbow and a wrist. An equatorial telescope is an instrument fixed to an equatorial mount. And an equatorial mount is simply a support structure that allows its telescope to move in the right ascension. This means it can be pointed at an object in the sky and remain fixated on it even as the Earth rotates. So then, a coudé is a periscope reaching through the atmosphere while countering the Earth's rotation. This allowed the astronomer to peer at shining stars as if they were sneaking a peek at surface ships while maintaining station against the tide.

Most refractor telescopes of Philippe's day stressed their humans. The investigator was semi-prone beneath the lenses on a barely movable platform under a barely positionable dome with a large gash to let in the rain and snow. Cold. Heavy. Uncomfortable. As refractors scaled up in the eighteen and nineteen hundreds, this discomfort only grew worse.

A coudé is more humane. The investigator merely sits at a desk. They look down comfortably. Light reaches their eye through two mirror assemblies. One rotates on the polar axis. The other rotates perpendicularly to that. The result is that the investigator sits in a closed, warm, fixed environment with handy controls and a clear view of much of the sky.

In typical French fashion, the coudé is comfortable, sophisticated, and stylish. It is also equally French in being finicky, over-complicated, and a bit dimmer than telescopes that look in fewer mirrors. Seven coudés were made. All were briefly successful. None were upgraded. None survived.

Besançon's coudé was no exception. Nevertheless, its remains and stately building were worth a look. When the coudé was removed the layout had changed. Most of the space was given over to |la salle équatoriale|, a tall workshop cum library. Above, the small dome housing the azimuth and other telescopes. Philippe and Phaeton had a look and moved on.

At the time of Phaeton's visit, simpler telescopes were available at the Observatory. There was a reflector somewhat larger than Phaeton's favorite scope at the Godlee Observatory on Sackville Street back home. Also several moderately large refractors. A rare and historically important altazimuth occupied the Equatorial Coudé building. It was used as a time-making backup to the meridian for certain weather conditions.

At the five o'clock mark of the circular way facing into the grounds was a traditional three-story dome. It housed a large clock drive equatorial. The fifty-centimeter Secrétan normal triple astrograph was then still an important instrument. It comprised a powerful objective with two photographic lenses and one visual lens. This apparatus was the means of Besançon Observatory's contribution to the |Carte du Ciel|. It also had value in tracking other transient visitors. Soon enough it would spy on Soviet satellites.

And of course, there was the Great Meridian mounted in its own geometrically precise building. A metal retractable roof exposed the instrument. One of France's lasting monuments to Father Time.

In the schemata of the grounds, the Great Meridian and the Chronometry Building housing the Time Lab faced each other in a rank of elegant structural similarity. Whereas, the Equatorial Coudé and Astrograph Dome preceded one another in a file. Other lesser buildings of the departments clustered around their larger parents. In this way, Chronos and Astros passed each other at right angles across the circular green. Only rarely did they cohabit labs or collaborate on research.

"
The pair worked their way clockwise around the campus margin using the horse path. As they did, a pair of eyes observed them from a small office above the Time Lab. Obsessive eyes flitted from stopwatch and graph paper to window. They focused on Philippe. The man's eyes needed sleep. There obviously wasn't time.

In the foyer, some feet from the watcher's office an ancient astronomical regulator struck five p.m. Out on the circle Philippe looked at the sky and at his watch. He abruptly held Phaeton back from continuing across to the Chronometry Building. Philippe apologized, he remembered work that needed completing. Perhaps they could regroup in the morning? He would show Phaeton his place in the astronomy section. They would begin the work.

Two pairs of eyes looked at |le Directeur|. Both saw hesitations and tics. Both wondered at the sudden stop. Phaeton quickly became distracted by his growling stomach. He would pedal kilometers to do something about it.

Thierry Louis Hrique laid his pen on the graph paper vertically aligned. He clicked the stop button on his chronograph and sat back. He needed a calibration of this young Englishman. The young man's appearance was suspicious. The timing was suspect. Even before his arrival the worrying signs had already been clear.

Thierry stowed his notes and pocketed his chronograph. He unlocked the office door. Leaned into the short hall and spoke such that his deep voice carried all the way to the back of the Time Lab on the other side of the building below ground. Pressing his buzzer would have been more subtle.

"Malvoyant! Come here.

Aubert soon scrambled up the stairs to Thierry.

"Qui, professeur. Que puis-je faire pour aider?

Thierry straightened his back. He judged this dull Besantin instrument's precision akin to that of a music box. Aubert was, however, eager and mailable.

"You saw the visitor Monsieur le Directeur perambulated this afternoon, yes?

Aubert nodded vigorously.

"Indeed, I met him briefly.

The older man straightened unconsciously to give his command.

"Get to know him. Learn what he studies, what results he has had, where he comes from, who sent him. Learn what research he will help Messier with.

He paused looking sternly at Aubert's unthoughtful face. It was late in the day. There were no sounds coming from downstairs. He decided to be over-clear.

"This is important. Start now! It is a matter of la défense du temps constant.

His words and severe look flooded into Aubert's open face.

"Absolument! I understand.

Thierry looked at his watch. Aubert noted it. He lifted his leather apron over his head. Said good evening hurriedly. Ran to the empty lab to grab his things. Aubert was glad there was no one to ask after his plans for the evening.

Hrique, Master Watchmaker and Head of the Besançon Observatory's Chronometry Service, was not known as a patient man. That was the lesser of Aubert's concerns. As |Chevalier Sénéchal Horloger| of the Defenders of Constant Time, Hrique was little short of terrifying. And a direct order!

Three minutes later Aubert fled the building, coat flapping. He grabbed his bicycle and rushed after Phaeton into the gathering night.

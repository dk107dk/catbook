>1951 - Noshunse, Rabaha, Cas, and Phaeton flying to Cairo

Eighteen hours after the incident on |Rue de l'Observatoire|, a Bristol 166 Buckmaster lumbered past the lights of Marseille at altitude. It headed towards Corsica. Colonel Russ Noshunse flew awkwardly, left arm bound in a sling. Not broken, but not comfortable. He sipped a noxious blend of analgesic powders, dextroamphetamine, and nitrogen-infused Illy.

In the copilot's seat, Rabaha Zayani. She was rapidly learning the controls. Mainly by speed-reading a dog-eared RAF Pilots Notes. But also by carefully observing the vehemence of Noshunse's reactions as she twisted nobs and flipped switches. She giggled.

Noshunse was terrified of Rabaha. Of her preternatural confidence. How she felt it within her abilities to jump into the cockpit and in three hours be ready to fly the largest, fastest, highest-flying heavy bomber training platform fielded by the allied command. After some observation, he decided she had a way with planes much like he had a way with air forces. He kept a sharp eye on her.

"
Gabrielle Flammarion had pointed at Rabaha standing solidly in the wreckage holding Noshunse up.

"You will go with him.

He hadn't known then what she meant. But that was it. Rabaha had become his copilot and navigator. If needs be, he was sure, also his tail gunner.

Phaeton lay in the back on a bunk beneath the scratched astrodome. His eyes were not watching the stars. Cas Corter kept Phaeton's blankets snug within the restraining straps. He monitored Phaeton's pupils and temperature. Cas's eyes were blackened. His cheeks, chin, and ears were raw. He was plastered and sutured. In the red light, his face was ghoulish. He had a jerking lack of full mobility to his upper torso. It had been twenty-two hours since the climax of the worst drive of his life. Utterly destroying the beautiful Talbot Lago Record pained him almost as much as his whole battered body did.

The plan was basic. Get the plane to Corsica. Land for four to six hours of sleep, refueling, food, and intelligence gathering. Then, all being well, back in the air for the six-hour leg to Cairo. At Cairo, again, all being well, they would find transportation to Alexandria. In Alexandria, they would close ranks with the sisters as they stepped off the |Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes| packet steamer |Falaise| from Marseille. It was going to be a tight thing. Cas was skeptical. He thought Noshunse and Rabaha were expecting time travel.

Noshunse was at that moment, in fact, completely on board with time travel. He couldn't get Gabrielle's dry voice out of his head. Or the unbelievable images. Medics and her staff had been busy saving lives. She took his arm. She walked him unsteadily to the Observatory gate in a dream state. At the top of the tower, she pointed him at a seventy-millimeter refractor mounted on a heavy iron gimbal. Back screaming. Eye too painful to touch the eyepiece. The image jumped and slid. She held him and helped focus.

"Look. You must understand how things stand.

There had been flashing lights and smoke. |Pont des Belles-Fontaines| was a crater. A twisted car was hanging through the stone railing at the top of the approach. It was burning. The eight-meter-high statues were gone.

"The boy did that.

Gabrielle guided the telescope along the road from the river to the park. A wide trail led to the aftermath of the catastrophic incident in |Rue de l'Observatoire|. More smoke. More destroyed cars. More torn-up ground.

Noshunse could say nothing. He felt a chill. What was he actually dealing with? No amount of incomprehensible journals, family secrets, secret handshakes, and black budgets readied you for a young man who ripped the earth as he ran like a rain of two-thousand-pound gravity bombs.

"Pourtant, nous commençons à peine. You must soothe him. For all our sakes. Before it all spins out of hand. You cannot simply walk away.

Noshunse screwed up his eyes. Mind, spinning. Ideas scrambled.

"How do you propose I do that?

He was unused to asking questions like that. He was always the one who knew what to do. Right or wrong. And others didn't ask because he was already doing it.

"How did you find him?

Noshunse leaned on the parapet. He was slowly coming back to himself. And finding himself suddenly tired.

"There are two others. They were with him. They are also... unique.

Gabrielle looked at him sharply.

"Come. You need coffee.

She turned abruptly away. What else could he do but follow? He could barely stand.

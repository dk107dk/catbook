>1618 - 1951 - Phaeton becomes an astronomer in Lancashire, England

On a foggy spring morning in 1618 Jeremiah Horrocks, son of James Horrocks, was born quietly near Toxteth Park. The true gravity of the moment was lost on his parents, as indeed all of England. The boy grew rapidly. James and Mary poured all their love and attention into their children. In particular, James poured into Jeremiah the love of watchmaking. Thereby, love of Lord Time, his stars, the planets, and the moon.

In 1632, Jeremiah solemnly signed his name below his father's, in the latinate style, Horrox, on a letter of introduction and remittance to cousins in Cambridge. He packed clothes, notebook, and the tools of a watchmaker apprentice. He said his goodbyes and left Toxteth Park for Emmanuel College on foot. The road was dark. Shelter was sparse. Cambridge was as far as the moon. Jeremiah was fourteen.

At Emmanuel, Jeremiah studied assiduously for six months. His sizarship afforded him room, board, and the drudgery of tutoring several scions of his patrons. He demonstrated a command of mathematics that served his young gentlemen well in their studies. As his performant activities tailed off in the evenings, he was able to apply himself. He devoured the works of Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, and Nicolaus Copernicus.

At the end of a year, Jeremiah began to feel he indeed belonged. He walked more confidently among the eminent scholars. The results of his observations of the heavens were convincing evidence that he was not wrong. He began to gain a little attention.

The following spring, 1633, Jeremiah unexpectedly gained the attention of the only gravitationally bound body he was ultimately unable to predict the motions of. Magdalene Croesia Sutton, step-grandniece of legendary financier Thomas Sutton. Maggie was in Cambridge in the hopes of striking a good match.

Her mission notwithstanding, Maggie numbered among those whose attentions were snagged on craggy, daydreamy Jeremiah. Jeremiah sang each week at Emmanuel Chapel. At first, Maggie found him and his harmonics odd. Then oddly fascinating. After a time, she stopped avoided his seeing her observing him. An observer himself, he had already caught on.

Maggie staked out Emmanuel. She was of an unladylike nature. Far from the wealth of her cousins. Nevertheless, she was enough of means to avoid many worldly strictures. After studying Jeremiah from afar, she eventually decided: she was attracted to the young scholar. As their orbits inclined, their harmonic resonance resulted in mutual tidal heating.

They discovered a shared fascination with the calculations of the heavens. The discovery was made on short walks along Paddock pond after mass. These led to longer walks on the river. And eventually even crepuscular stargazing, at the risk of serious consequences for their concomitant indiscretions and follies. Thenceforth, Maggie's memory thrilled in every glimpse of the light of the moon.

"
In time, all good things must pass. In 1635, Maggie and Jeremiah were abruptly banished from the halo of England's scholarly constellations. They were separated to the intellectually dark reaches of, respectively, London and Lancaster. Approbation followed. As then typical, it followed Maggie more than Jeremiah.

Jeremiah's hasty retreat north and west, despite its declination, put him on a trajectory to influence the future of astronomy. His last letter to Maggie spoke longingly of his |Venus in sole visa|. In time, his lovely metaphor transformed into a graceful calculation. The transit of the actual heavenly Venus across the face of the sun. It happened precisely as he predicted. That prediction became his most celebrated claim to brilliance, though far from the only one. Its success lessened his longing. He was distracted permanently skyward.

And then, in 1641, like many brilliant things that arc across the heavens, Jeremiah abruptly died. He was but twenty-two.

"
On reaching London, Maggie had been castigated by her widowed mother. Maggie's mother had counted on Maggie making a good match. Foiled, she packed Maggie off to her most distant relations. In the outer darkness on the upper reaches of the River Mersey. Thence, she was directed to the sleepy parish of Holmes Chapel.

Holmes Chapel was so far off the beaten path of England's burgeoning cities as to be the wilderness. There, Maggie's grand aunt's cousin's daughter Elsie was married to a successful yeoman of Irish extraction. His name was Athair. The couple was desirous of a child, unlucky in this aspect, and willing to take in Maggie in a sisterly way while relieving her of her unfortunate affordance. Maggie acquiesced.

The years of farm and village passed. They failed to burr off Maggie's edges. Most damningly, they failed to turn up a suitably broad-minded country gentleman. Finally, in the autumn of 1639, Maggie was allowed back to London. Little John Athair never really knew his real mother.

Maggie resumed life at the dim candle-lit edge of the grand ball of the celestial elite of the emerging empire. Or at least she tried to. Maggie was by then largely unknown. She was just one of many lesser distaff threads of a family grown large in legend even as its wealth and influence grew diffuse. Despite all efforts, her fashion in dress was at best that of the fall before.

On occasion, she was introduced to learned men. She would ask after Jeremiah. She felt a twinge regardless of their answers. Her heart never uncreased. Soon enough, Maggie took work. Her days grew quiet.

Then in January 1665, the plague arrived in Westminster. It got bad rapidly. Not possessing her own country estate, nor either sufficient ties to her wealthy cousins, Maggie hid in her small apartment. The tread of the dead carts became as barking dogs.

One morning she called on her housekeeper and landlord to carry her on a narrow door across the lane to the Artilerie Yard. Under the circumstances, no matter their feelings for her, they were content to oblige. She died in a delirium sometime before dawn the following day. Staring up at the bright white Comet of 1665. Her last scrambled thoughts were of Jeremiah's glasses reflecting the light of the moon.

"
Meanwhile, John Athair grew up in a modest but comfortable manor house. He knew only Elsie and William as his parents. Only rarely did he hear Maggie's name as his distant, cherishing aunt. His connection to her was unremarked.

John grew into a hardworking and successful citizen. Townsfolk were pleased he attained his majority without being run down by a drayman while absorbed in the light of the moon. As he matured, he took a leading part in village life as an alderman and rentier. He married, had children, taught them well. In later years, he was credited with deep thoughts.

Five Venus transits later, John's descendant, Phaeton Athair, was likewise entranced by the heavens and deep thoughts. Phaeton was an independent-minded and curious child. He taught himself to read along as his father read him bedtime stories. He learned to do sums by "helping" his dad keep the books. He was obviously bright.

And yet, a few early years of boarding school left his instructors puzzled. How could a youth so promising daydream his way to such low marks? Had his parents seriously decided his primary education should prioritize H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Edgar Rice Burroughs?  Phaeton's parents both agreed, yes, they had. And disagreed, no, they weren't looking for parenting advice. Pronouncements as to Phaeton's future were unwelcome.

The result, Phaeton was homeschooled. His parents had resources. They enjoined employees and business partners. His schooling was practical. Lands management, construction, electrification, accounting, telegraphy, and surveying. After learning not to daydream around sharp implements, important sums, or sparks, he enjoyed his nontraditional education immensely.

In the evenings Phaeton's mother, Mariella, taught him advanced maths. She did it through the calculation of star tables. For Phaeton, the numerology of the stars only increased his sense of wonder. It floored him that not only did the heavens move, but they did so predictably. Through Phaeton's wide eyes Ella relived the carefree summers of her youth.

She had grown up in Sussex on the Hanbury Estate. Her father, Simon Pritchard, worked for Frederick Janson Hanbury as his Estate Manager. Hanbury was the site of the private Brockhurst Observatory. At the age of ten, her father introduced Ella to William Sadler Franks, then director of the Observatory. Franks was a past Star Colors Section Director of the Liverpool Astronomical Society. Star catalogues were his main thing.

The year he met Ella, Franks, with the support of his employer, hosted the Royal Astronomical Society's annual summer meeting. Among other luminaries, it was attended by the heir to the Swedish throne. At the gala, Franks came to know that little Ella had calculated all the financials for the event. Franks was charmed by the local girl with a head for numbers. Two summers later she became his Observatory's second computer.

Ella loved calculations. Frank loved building catalogues. He put Ella to work updating tables of the errors of the positions of stars. She calculated higher precision proper motions. She gleefully whipped up covariance matrices and the trigonometric parallax. It was far more interesting than calculating the interest on rents due or the proper loading of granaries.

As she worked, Frank explained star colors. The motions of the Messier objects. How to spot double stars and predict the path of Venus. Ella let that all wash over her. She just loved the numbers. And she wanted Phaeton to as well.

By the 1940s, the expanding Manchester economy had dragged Holmes Chapel into a stable suburban orbit. War, recovery, growth. Soon enough, various departments of the University of Manchester reached out to purchase properties in the area of the village. As they did so, they attracted a young man with practical hands and distracted thoughts. He gravitated to the natural sciences. And, naturally, to astronomy.

Had Phaeton known he was a direct descendant of one of English astronomy's founding fathers he could not have found his head fixed more firmly above the clouds. He ambled about the same rolling acres as ever his forebears did. And yet, Phaeton was also approximately at the center of the astronomical universe. Soon the heavens would open wide to the boy with starry eyes.

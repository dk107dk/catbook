>1951 - Phaeton leaves Manchester, England

"Am I doing the right thing?

An unfocused young astronomer took a bench at Oxford Road Railway Station. He hunched under dripping eves, well back from the platform edge. The rain had just the one traveler to focus on. Fifteen minutes to wait. Then one stop to a change at Manchester Piccadilly and on south east to London.

Phaeton Athair shuffled worn K boots. Was he being pushed away from Victoria University's Astronomy Department? His advisor had, unprompted, arranged a summer fellowship for him in France. Purportedly, Besançon Observatory was in dire need of hands to help with Important Research. It seemed not just any hands would do. An honor was implied. Could he have declined?

Phaeton's hands had expected to be deep in the mud of Jodrell Bank wrangling high power electrics in the service of astronomic innovation. Ramshackle Jodrell was quickly becoming ground zero of the new field of radio astronomy. Few more exciting opportunities existed. Moreover, easy access to dinner at his parents' home in Holmes Chapel beat struggling with French grammar at a second tier time-obsessed optical observatory almost, but not quite, in Switzerland. He hoped France's stars would compare well.

The train hooted once. Unaccountably it stopped on the s-bend ahead of the curved platform. The rain probed the decrepit wooden roof methodically. It found a new crack above Phaeton. Rodents under the facing platform paused. They stared curiously at the student. The student was lost in the statistics of rain splatter over time.

This went on for quite a while. The participants – train, student, rats, rain clouds – experienced their own individual contemplations, convections, and cast iron thoughts.

At a certain point, without apparent signal, they converged on a single time frame. The 4-6-2 tank locomotive, a tired Great Central Railway K9, slumped to a stop just ahead of the young man. He stirred, picked up his rucksack and modest suitcase, and boarded the first car. Not long after, the locomotive stretched, blew, and rumbled on.

With the railcars passed, the rodents were shocked. The bench the young man had rested on had collapsed. Its wood decomposed. The remains of its iron fittings trickled after the train in rich streams of rust.

The empty platform remained empty. The daylight faded into dusk. Phaeton was in motion. For better or worse, Besançon crept closer.

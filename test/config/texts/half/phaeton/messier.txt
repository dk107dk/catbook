The recipient of Lovell's letter, Philippe Messier, was a lineal astronomer. He was several generations removed from his better-known forebear, Charles Messier. Charles was narrowly famous for cataloging deep sky objects that annoyed him. He did that in the 1700s. Back then, lists of annoying things could still ensure your name would be remembered. Those distracting objects had taken time from Charles's quest to be France's foremost Ferret of Comets, so-called by Louis XV. Philippe, while of similar interests and qualities, was not at all famous. He was Director at the Besançon Observatory. Sadly, by the 1950s Besançon Observatory was no longer at the forefront of anything.

Philippe was best known, also narrowly, for his strenuous attempts to change that reputation. For almost two decades he had, to the best of his abilities, held the Observatory's Chronometry Service and its Astronomical Department in a fractious personal union. It was a struggle. Nevertheless, somehow, he was well-liked by most, if not all.

Chronometry, and the study of the timing of electromagnetic phenomena, had been his first love. Every day he hustled to keep the Chronometry Service relevant in the face of ever-accelerating technical change. First, he struggled against quartz technology. Then he studied it, accepting what he could not forestall. Not long after, he had learned new uses for the word cesium. The grinding cycle renewed. The precise adversaries of clockwork were implacable. Nevertheless, Philippe persevered.

At the same time, Philippe fought to find new support for astronomy. With new sources of funds, Philippe hoped to rebuild the Observatory's image. He imagined achieving that through imaging of unprecedented clarity using long baseline interferometry. The goal was to combine precisely timed signals from widely spaced telescopes in order to create a gargantuan virtual telescope. Not unlike his fight with the future of time, interferometry was a constellation of speculations. Nevertheless, in concept, its combining of precision timing with precision optics played to Besançon's historic strengths.

That evening, Philippe stood at a Juliet balcony over the tiny, winding |Rue des Fusillés de la Résistance|. Every day, as work concerns receded, internal pressure collapsed, he deflated. At the corner, |Cathédrale Saint-Jean| rang the evensong. The narrow road was quiet. Shadows. Pigeons and crows.

It had been seven years to the day. Almost to the hour. Philippe poured a thin stream of rose Poulsard down two floors to splatter wasted in the limestone courtyard. Aurélie walked that way behind a farm truck of the dying. Under the gun. On her way to her death. Aurélie. A high laugh pealed faintly. Probably from the new cafe on |Rue de la Convention|. Philippe's jaw clenched.

The world had moved on. Philippe had been left with a street named for forgotten heroes to help him remember. And with an unhealthy taste for drink. No matter the amount of Jura wine, or years, he wouldn't forget. He brooded:

"We are easily fractured, heal over-quick, ultimately unbreakable, but never quite whole.

Somewhere in the quiet town below someone was responsible for Aurélie's staggering walk to the train north. He had missed his chance to act as history says a Frenchman is wont so to do in the face of |un renversement de régime|: he had not knifed anyone in the street.

Though he hid it well, Philippe felt like a watch winding down. Losing time. He felt he should attend to the mainspring when he could. He had helpless moments, such as on that day. Philippe tried to intentionally unknot his shoulders in the moments he became aware of memories plucking at his nerves.
He calmed his mind. He would think of Aurélie another time. Philippe was a complicated mix of craftsman, scientist, historian, and amateur mechanic of his soul. The last of these was taking more and more effort away from his Observatory. He needed to work.

Philippe had found a letter on returning to his rooms. It was from Manchester, UK. On any other day he would have immediately ripped it open. He was hungry for the brighter lights of bigger cities. Science with ambition, without limits. Instead, he had waited. Now the letter had additional work to do. He needed sufficient distraction. And lo and behold, there it was.

Bernard Lovell he had known from before the war. His letters didn't come to Besançon often these days. They had met in exciting times as younger men. Philippe's and Lovell's research had overlapped. They had both been funded in part by national governments preparing for war well before their populations realized the inevitability of conflict. Theirs was to deflect or accelerate humanity through the darkness by the application of science.

Lovell had wrapped his research of what would later become known as radar in cosmic ray experiments. Philippe consulted on the concept of radio pulse timing to the |Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil| in the private sector. Avro Lancaster pilots would soon after profit from their combined insights. Allied lives had been saved. The war, won.

Back then, the two scientists had collaborated by correspondence on the development of testing apparatus for |le magnétron à résonance électronique|, meeting once at a conference in Lyon. Lovell had taken that weekend to visit Besançon, staying with Philippe and Aurélie. The weather had been fine. Lovell had thought the town's melange of architectural styles exquisite. He had not been back. Philippe had followed his work from afar.

Now, suddenly, out of the clear blue sky Lovell was sending someone to Philippe. With a plea. The young man, Phaeton Athair, was, according to the professor, in need of help. He needed a change of scene, a hard problem, and a steady hand. In return, Lovell thought Phaeton might help Philippe. Lovell thought the lad brilliant. Together they might reach a result worthy of publication.

Despite all, Philippe was determinedly optimistic. And helping hands were welcome. Just maybe, by means of precision interferometry, they might return the light to sleepy Besançon.

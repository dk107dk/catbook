At Victoria University in Manchester, Phaeton's first foray was to the Astronomy Department. More practical matters were lower on the list. First the universe! Then the Bursar, Housing, and the Registrar.

Now, Phaeton was a lad of seventeen. One coming to the big city school at an age most don't know which way is left and which is right, let alone where their life-long interests lie. Phaeton, however, had already sampled much, thanks to his atypical education. He had had a first-hand brush with accounting, engineering, surveying and construction, veterinary medicine, real estate law, and more. Just enough to think he knew what he did not want to do.

What he knew he loved was star gazing. And tracking the motion of the planets. And reading all the dog-eared science fiction cached randomly on the many over-burdened bookcases of his home. More vocationally, the waxing moon affected planting and sodding. Likewise, the tidal sequence had a percentage influence on water management and power generation. Ultimately the moon had a financial impact on Phaeton's wherewithal to matriculate. Regardless, science fiction won over agronomy walking. Phaeton didn't visit the Agriculture Department. Ever.

Phaeton first met Bertrand Lovell in the same way that cosmic rays first meet the atmosphere. Namely, they collided. Doctor Lovell was Professor B. to some, though typically not face-to-face. Dr. Fish to others, because, obviously, C comes after B, and astronomers see stuff, so what do they see? Seafish, naturally. And for reasons of respect for an esteemed don, Dr. Fish. Right? Right.

Anyway. Lovell was an up-and-comer in the growing Astronomy Department. He had been attached to the Telecommunications Research Establishment in radar research and development during the war. Night fighters, bombers, submarine detection. Returning to university, he had continued to pursue the promise of radar as a tool of astronomy. With radar, he thought he might peer beyond the atmosphere in wavelengths beyond human vision. Cosmic rays, meteors, the hydrogen line. It was exciting.

Back then, despite rapid development in wartime, radar was still a rather new concept. One with many science and engineering mysteries attached. Hyperbolic growth comes easy, for a time, given a low base in an expanding field of knowledge. Radar in astronomy was one such area. Lovell and his mates found they could undertake cockeyed contraptions-based experiments in a cash-poor department and still stumble across cosmic insights that would be celebrated worldwide. That's what being present at the creation is about. Lovell was having a blast.

Professor B. was well-liked on campus. He was bright, persuasive, and of good humor. At the same time, driven, demanding, and considered a hard grader. Some thought he interacted with common sense weakly. Lovell moved through closed doors much like light moves through the glass windows of academic offices, which is to say, only fractionally slower. And for that reason, he nearly knocked Phaeton down coming out of the Astronomy office as Phaeton was heading more tentatively in.

Lovell regained his balance with nary a glance. Hollered sorry old chap behind him and was gone. Nevertheless, the imprint of Phaeton's surprised face in his memory was apparently stronger than Phaeton would have guessed. Strong enough that when Phaeton gingerly occluded Lovell's own door three weeks later looking for a part-time job on the university's dime, his signal was quickly processed and reflected.

"You can lift one hundred or two hundred pounds?

Phaeton was expecting a shallower angle of incidence. His corresponding emission did not carry a lot of information.

"You're not a regular, you're a first-year, your jacket looks worn and you look nervous. I'll guess you're looking for a job. When you barricaded the department office with your body the other week you seemed robust. So, my answer is, if you can lift more than one hundred pounds and the department's cost is minimal, absolutely!

That weekend in the muddy fields at Jodrell Bank they found that Phaeton could dead-lift to chest height what they estimated was about one hundred and thirty. Not astronomical, but not bad. Lovell said jolly good and left him to keep doing it. As well as a part-time job, Phaeton had apparently found his thesis advisor in a field he was well qualified to criticize as not being sufficiently well cared for by the same. It was perfect. They would build the future there.

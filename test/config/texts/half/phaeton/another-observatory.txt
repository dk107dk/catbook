>1951 - Phaeton on the road to Juvisy-sur-Orge, France

The Peugeot died abruptly. It was barreling down the middle of a lane. Heading north towards the outskirts of the Capital. The French countryside was whipping past at more than one hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. The motor coughed once. Phaeton checked the rearview mirror. A moment later another coughing fit. Then the car died in motion as if mounting the gates of Paris.

Phaeton was forced to quickly calculate a combination of trajectory, attitude, and delta-v. His aim was to decelerate into the ditch. Hopefully safely. Definitely in the most unobtrusive way possible. Even a chance that his pursuers would miss the fact that his car was out of the running was worth the risk of taking it off-road at speed.

The problem was, there was no ditch. He could go off the pavement anywhere equally well. The road was only about a lane and a half. It lay in a furrow between modest slopes of brush and trees. Over a distance the upward trend was noticeable. The way curved gently, hiding the cars from one another. Its tarry aggregate sloughed in a glacier trough towards the distant sea. The suburbs of the city were still kilometers ahead.

A shallow curve showed Phaeton a break in the trees. Likely a stream crossing. The cupping shoulders opened. The land fell away from the road for twenty meters before the trees restarted. A low wooden rail ran a few lengths on either side of the road. Phaeton saw a fleeting chance. He took it without thinking.

The Peugeot stuttered and pawed at the declining margin. The bonnet jumped. The wheel took Phaeton in the bridge of his nose. The left front wheel dropped precipitously. As the right side ascended the car rotated on a forty-five-degree twisting wind about its equator. At the same time, its grille rotated down its prime meridian as the tail lights orbited sharply up.

The meandering stream bed was deeper than Phaeton guessed. As he arced down he thought:

"Oh, good.

He did not think:

"I'm about to die as I'm thrown through the windshield.

As it happened, the car was fairly well aimed at an eddying sinkhole positioned below a narrow point bar. The car hit the steep downslope hard. It clattered four meters below the road and plowed into the turgid water.

Phaeton did not, of course, fare well. His nose took another beating. His head smashed out the windshield. His chest crumpled. However, the car's roof stayed just above the water. He breathed.

Ten seconds later the first pursuing car passed above, wheezing at speed. The second shortly after. Neither had the power of the Peugeot. Because the pursuers struggled on the grade, Phaeton had a little time to recover. He used most of it just holding his chin barely above water.

Slowly Phaeton struggled to the bank. He headed upstream. Bagless, bloodied, but with the |Cartoguide de la Société des Pétroles Shell| clutched in one battered hand. Tens of minutes later the chasing cars circled back. Doors opened. Hands waved. Flashlights and wading. Frère Michel's voice's low rumble.

Phaeton was almost a kilometer upstream. He was several bends from the road and completely unaware. His focus was putting one foot in front of the other. The car was dead. He was alive. Cori was far away. Their pursuers were following his trail, not hers. For that moment, that was enough.

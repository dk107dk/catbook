The Camille Flammarion Observatory at Juvisy-sur-Orge had watched the skies since 1882. Coincidentally, since about the same time as Besançon Observatory. It stood at the top of a long rise from the Orge tributary and its confluence with the river Seine. The town was about twenty kilometers south of Paris on |Route nationale numéro sept|.

The Observatory was on the former post road, |Avenue de la Cour de France|. A small house was converted into a way station under the auspices of the Court. The largely wooded plot had originally been known as Fromenteau Farm. In a demonstration of its importance to communications, Napoleon's retinue first learned of the capitulation of Paris there on a cold March evening in 1814.

Over the years the posthouse became more landmark than national infrastructure. Eventually, it fell into private hands. In due course, its owner came to be one Louis-Eugène Méret, a successful businessman and landowner from Bordeaux. By Méret's time, the original forest grounds had been sectioned. A wooded park with two stately homes occupied the majority. The posthouse and extensive gardens had been enclosed on the remaining third. The two parks were sectioned by a high-walled lane.

Méret, as a lonely old man, saw Paris's flamboyant astronomer, science fiction writer, and metaphysician as a worthy cause. He anonymously transferred the post house building and its grounds to Flammarion. The sole stipulation: that the gift be to the advancement of astronomical science. Other donations of equipment followed, along with Flammarion's own investment in building a small but impactful institution. Talent arrived. Science was done.

The building is imposing for its location. It sits on the corner of |la Cour de France| and |Rue de l'Observatoire|. Its great arched foregate was angled to the intersection. On the right, facing Observatory Lane, a two-story stable was built into the compound wall and renovated to house students, fellows, and staff. On the left, along the main avenue, was the four-story posthouse.

While the posthouse, stables, and grounds would not classify as fortified; nevertheless, they were built to be defensible. To the immediate right of the gate, a massive crenelated tower with a single Norman window commanded the approach. Along the main wall, high narrow windows with strong internal shutters spaced along the third floor. A turret protruded from the sheer wall at the second, third and fourth. An army might march right in. Bandits, however, would be seriously challenged.

The building's retrofit as an observatory was made most obvious by the equatorial room. A round turret bulged from the center of the fourth floor. It was capped by a seven-meter instrument dome rising four meters above the room below. The dome had an unusual shutter whose three petals blossomed wide as the night fell. Within, the center space was fully taken by a large brass and steel twenty-five-centimeter equatorial mount refractor. Other telescopes stood in adjourning rooms, including a sixteen-centimeter azimuth reflector.

Arrayed around the elegant central staircase Flammarion positioned his collections of lesser philosophical instruments, a research library, study rooms, and offices. On the first floor, foyer, parlor, dining room, and kitchen. At the back of the main building, an attached two-story cottage that housed the family. In all, the observatory stretched almost forty meters from the tower and gate to the cottage. A large edifice, visible from all directions.

Noshunse could have spotted the Observatory through binoculars. That is, if he were looking. He was not. He was busy attempting to bring a Boulton Paul Balliol down safely at Villeneuve-Orly. It had been his first flight over water. Only his second night landing. His third flight ever in the Balliol. Noshunse was a fast learner. He was doing fine.

The Balliol was a twin-seat Royal Air Force training turboprop. It was lightly armed and only good for about eight hundred miles. Orly Air Base had been pushed into a dusty corner off to the side of the commercial field. It had five Quonset Huts, various equipment, and an inferior tower. The Americans were upgrading it for service with Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, or SHAPE. Supporting SHAPE was a new mission. Supporting random Brits dropping in solo by trainer was distracting. Regardless, the base commander quickly okayed the unplanned arrival and made urgent arrangements.

The air over the base was misty and rough. Noshunse was newly instruments-rated. The lights were up. Traffic was modest. Noshunse brought the plane down with ten liters to spare. The military taxiway was short and the apron was well-ordered. He jumped out and waited as a |Grande Routière| pulled up. A gunmetal-and-navy Talbot Lago Record. A steel bruiser of one hundred and fifty horsepower. The denizens of a utilitarian air base had no business having such a beautiful machine. Americans!

Noshunse's driver was crisp. He had been waiting. They exited the checkpoint fifteen minutes later, barreling down the Heart of France. Noshunse's elevated heart rate was steady. Cas Corter's was lower.

Let's look at where everyone was at the starting gun.

Phaeton stood under the over-complicated bridge. At the point where he stood |Avenue de la Cour de France| began a slight bend. The bend took it from a northwest heading to a line due north. The surrounding street grid, prowled by Frère Michel, was oriented north-northeast. Xavier and Victor were five kilometers south, heading towards the bridge and observatory. Noshunse was eight klicks north, purposefully closing on the observatory from the other direction. Hrique and Aubert were far away, heading south. After several calls from the road, Hrique was playing a hunch.

Constables Henri Blum and Bernard Boulanger were taking the scenic route. They headed up one of |Général| Charles de Gaulle's many roads. It took them to the winding hill past |Parc des Grottes|. The park was a remnant of the vast grounds of |le Château de Juvisy|, before it and the overwhelming panorama of its formal gardens were bombed into history. Blum had thought to double-check that the local kids weren't getting up to mischief. He hadn't realized they were already late to a crisis.

At that moment, Phaeton's hands were clasped behind him. He clutched a crevasse in the limestone wall. Eyes closed in the dim space. He was far away. He felt the spin of distant stars more than he felt his own shivering skin. He was lonely, alone, and nearly done.

That same moment, Frère Michel drew a bead on the darkness under the bridge. He stood on the running board. Two-cylinder engine ticking over. Leaning on the roof. Arms draped across the diminutive car. He fired a farmer's shotgun at nothing. How did he know it would flush Phaeton out? Who can say? And the police? That part of Juvisy-sur-Orge was just overgrown fields. Then again, Frère Michel also just didn't give a damn. His tiny automobile rocked hard on its springs.

Phaeton's head snapped back into the bridge wall. His fingers clenched. He fell forward. Submerged in panic. He crawled, swam, and staggered to the other end of the channel. Frère Michel caught the faint splash. He couldn't see Phaeton. Phaeton didn't know that. Frère Michel dropped down into the driver's seat, spun the car, and peeled out northwest hunting a cross street.

At the far end there was a landing and stairs. They switch-backed several flights up to the road. Phaeton leaped up the steps. He only fell once. The top was a stone balcony behind the statue facing Father Time's struggle with Discord. The moon rose blearily before him.

By this time the Shell Cartoguide was soaked and shredded. Down to one last square of the original foldout map. Phaeton didn't need it. He started to run.

Another shotgun blast. This time from the other side. Frère Michel had found a way to the field on the other side of the bridge. High up, Phaeton was certain he was seen now. He ran down the long rampart. Trees and occasional streetlights. Frère Michel's engine faded. Phaeton assumed that meant he intended to head Phaeton off. He ran harder.

"
Up on the roof walk, Gabrielle saw the sparks in the distance. She felt things coming to a head. She hurried over to the tower at the front right of the observatory. Grabbing a hammer she whacked a ship's bell. It rang loud enough for the whole compound to hear. She slammed the hammer down again and again.

Barreling down the all but empty boulevard towards the observatory, all of Noshunse's finely tuned senses were in an uproar. He catapulted into the front of the saloon to command Cas in unnecessary French.

"Se dépêcher. Do not stop. Make my speed cent trente kilomètres par heure!

Meanwhile, on the roof, Gabrielle had forgotten something.

"Fergie, the signal light!

Ferdinand dove into the fourth-floor rooms. The signal was a Fresnel-lens semaphore lamp. Odette had bought it surplus for its strong iron swivel mount. Seeing it in the foyer, Gabrielle had absconded with it to the instrument room for purposes unknown. She had cleaned it up and made it work. It blazed.

"
Not far now, Phaeton was flagging. He was running uphill on the dregs of adrenalin. He splashed past the barkeeper sweeping the front of |Au Petit Napoléon|, provoking a yell. His wet trousers flapped strangely. His feet slumped and squished. Mud crusted all over. He had become a steaming animated bog body. Could he see the observatory ahead? He had never seen it before. He was afraid he was wrong.

Then suddenly Frère Michel's squealing Citroën shuddered into the avenue two hundred meters behind him. Its springs groaned and popped. The tires clubbed as he oversteered across a storm grill. It was to Phaeton's benefit that the Citroën made only nine horsepower in a straight line, downhill.

There was a flash up ahead and the headlights behind. Phaeton drove into an ajar gate in the high wall he was running alongside. This was the city park. Originally part of the Méret estate. By that time, the larger part of the estate had been given over to the city. Its two stately homes were in disrepair. Its gravel lanes were overgrown. Brush tore at Phaeton's eyes from the dark. Nevertheless, the darkness seemed safer.

He was running on a path. It led generally uphill toward where the Observatory should be. Then a crunch and grinding heave as the 2CV took the curb and battered its way through the gate. Phaeton was fifty meters into the park. He got off the path. Fell through bushes. Got up. Ran. Fell again. The cycle repeated seemingly without end. He was only about one hundred and forty meters from the Observatory gate. He didn't know it.

The Citroën came up the path, parallel with him. Frère Michel's heavy face filled the undersized window. His gun wobbled at his shoulder. Frère Michel was struggling to get it braced. Phaeton tripped just as the big man's shotgun barked. He found himself face down. Muddy grass. Gunpowder. Gasoline. He wondered why he didn't just lie still. It was a heavy creeping seductive disassociation. He pushed it away.

Frère Michel almost lost control. He stomped a low bush and spun the steering wheel to avoid an elm. The clutch whined. He peeled away to the right heading slightly downhill. Frère Michel, normally silent, unloaded a barrage of Gaulish cussing. The gears chunked into low as he got the nose of the little car pointed up a path that ended at the hairpin corner of |Rue De l'Observatoire|. This was good. He had already been down that road twice so he knew: from that corner, the road was narrow, straight, had no sidewalks, just one opening, and was bounded by high walls. A shooting gallery. And Phaeton was running straight into it.

Now Phaeton saw a bright light through the tops of the trees. Over the dark outline of a second empire mansion. He ran down a pisolite drive at a wide gate in the high compound wall. The harsh white beacon from the Observatory tower slid in and out of the darkened mansard, vanes, and gables. He fell on the gate. It was solid. Engines coming fast. He found a little yett-like iron door on one side and heaved it open.

The Citroën tumbled itself over the granite step at the top of the path to the road. Frère Michel's head bashed into the roof. The little engine was at redline as the vehicle slid into the road. The back wheels fishtailed limply against gravity. Frère Michel cranked the rack and pinon left to get the car pointed uphill and down the narrow road. His speed picked up as the car came under control.

Constables Blum and Boulanger had come up |Boulevard de la Cascade|, behind |Parc Des Grottes|. They sling-shotted through the roundabout past |Rue Camille Flammarion| into |Rue de l'Observatoire|. To that point, they saw nothing out of the ordinary. Suddenly, in front of them, a scratched and muddy Citroën. Missing its front fender. Right headlight hanging. Bouncing into a tired southpaw stance and gamely accelerating. Blum stood on the brakes. Boulanger lost his hat. The rotating lights came on and the siren.

Phaeton heard the siren's wail. Heavy engines closing. He had the bars open. A lisping, lilting voice calling from the top of the wall across the narrow |Rue de l'Observatoire|. The top of the whitewashed wall glittered with glass fragments brighter and sharper than ice. A half-heard Brazilian lisp.

"Phaetonie. Come quick. Come here! Look at me!

Headlights roared at him. Rabaha flipped a blue blanket over the top of the wall. Black hair. Thin hands waving and calling. Phaeton saw shadows. He remembered Cori's hand in his. The headlights were on both sides now. The arc light high overhead dazzled. He was tangled in the ancient metal bars. They erupted spasmodically into oxidized powder under his flailing hands.

And then a glancing crash. Phaeton and the bars were thrown as Noshunse's saloon caromed past. Phaeton spun and flew. The big car slammed headlong into the flimsy Citroën. The little car reared up and back as two metric tonnes of speeding steel piled into its cheap aluminum panels. Frère Michel's shotgun discharged as his head crashed into the dashboard. The tin can was hurled back.

Phaeton himself flew for an eternity. Serene. Calm. Then he and the remains of the yett bars shattered the stuccoed brick of the city park wall. When sound caught up to him it was loud. But he didn't hear it. He wasn't there. Phaeton was gone into a dim land of starlit shadows.

The Citroën flipped on its back. It spun downhill screaming metallically. A trail of sparks. The bent frame smashed headlong into Henri Blum's Renault black and white, tearing uphill with lights flashing. The police siren rose in an unnatural shriek, then abruptly died. There was a storm of sheet metal, spraying fuel, and glass.

Noshunse and his aide-de-camp were both thrown violently. Improbably, both survived.

The long bonnet of the Talbot had crumpled back to them at speed. Its roof buckled and broke free. Glass strafed the lane. The massive steel frame ricocheted off the Citroën. After reversing the little car's direction the Talbot smashed through the Observatory wall. It came to a stop six meters in. Hanging cockeyed over a path, halfway through an ornamental pear.

The Talbot Lago's rubble provided continuity with the catastrophe across the lane. Where Phaeton went down the air had quaked and the ground shook. The wall was gone. Opened on a furrow of inexplicable destruction that stretched back along Phaeton's path through the park.

The three cars and the dust settled. More distant sirens approached. Eventually the screams and panic receded. Eventually, the tower light went out.

But the ground did not stop shaking. You could feel it all the way in Holmes Chapel.

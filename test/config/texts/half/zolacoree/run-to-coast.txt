>1951 - Cori, Zélie, and Phaeton on the run to Beaune

The moon rose slowly. Stars and scudding clouds. They stole gas to fill the tank. Zélie had pulled the Peugeot off the road at Saint Vit behind a dark gas station. Phaeton found a length of hose to siphon gas from a car waiting for repair. Cori watched him from the shadows.

They were in dark country, well beyond the part of Jura that Zélie was familiar with. There was a |Shell Touring Cartoguide| map in the glove box of their stolen car. She knew of Fraisans Commune. They thought they would look for an inn there. Dinner and rest. The roads were empty. They found a roadhouse called |l'Auberge du Ruisseau Sifflant|. It looked affordable. The matron fed them lamb, soup, and bread. They passed out.

After midnight a car pulled off the road. It hunched running in the drive. Cori woke easily and looked. She worried. They left by the backdoor. They had stashed the Peugeot in a dirt lane two hundred meters from the inn. The roads were black. Then, where the road crosses the Doubs at |Pont de Rans|, headlights. One car coming across the bridge. Another coming right at them. They turned away from both and sped south through the village.

Soon they branched off and found themselves on a ramrod-straight forest road. It ran five miles with no turn-offs. Zélie's knuckles blanched. Phaeton struggled with the map. There was nowhere for the car to hide. The narrow straightaway terminated in Arc-et-Senans. They were glad to escape the forest.

Soon after they pulled out of sight behind the walls of the |Saline royale d'Arc-et-Senans|. Cartoguide told them that the monumental Royal Salt Works, when constructed one hundred and fifty years prior, had been one of the greatest industrial sites in the world. Only in France would a salt factory deep in the provinces have the grandeur of an Egyptian necropolis.

They stretched their legs. They leaned against the wall to think. Day would break soon. The salt works grounds were manicured, plain, and exposed. A museum to an institution that had leached the saline out of the rocks so completely that the husk left behind was lush and fertile. Their tear ducts were crusty. Their eyes, dry. It was Sunday.

"They will be looking for us. We have to find another car or the train or something.

Cori was making sense. Zélie wanted to keep driving. She felt more comfortable driving than she would trapped on a train.

"I should call home. Professor Lovell might have someone we can go to.

Phaeton didn't say it but he was the only one of them that had someone to call. Cori was still in upset runaway mode. Neither girl's family had a phone. Besides that, would they get honest answers? On the other hand, there was a chance that Lovell might know something. After all, it was he who had sent Phaeton to Philippe.

The sun rose. They decided Phaeton should go to the police station. He would say he got on the wrong branch line. He was lost and without luggage. If luck held he would be allowed to make a long-distance call. Zélie thought the |gendarmerie| might allow him. It was worth a shot. If Lovell didn't answer they could try again down the road.

Phaeton left on his mission alone. Cori watched him go. The girls waited out of sight at the salt works. They guessed they were wanted as a group for car theft. Forty minutes later they were starting to get nervous. They sat in the shadow of the grand factory's proscenium. Far from the road.

Eventually, they saw Phaeton stroll up the long processional walk from the street to the pillars. He was so casual. Zélie put a protective hand on Cori's shoulder to keep her from going to Phaeton. He whistled as he walked. They wanted him to hurry.

"Halloo. I did it. I talked to Dr. B.

Phaeton seemed more relaxed than when he had left. He made it into the shaded |péristyle|. Leaned to the backside of a massive doric order column and let out a breath. He was suddenly tired. Cori put a hand on his arm.

"What did he say? What do we need to do?

Phaeton had notes on a scrap of paper.

"Lovell said to go north, to near Paris. Juvisy-sur-Orge. A friend of his named Russ Noshunse will meet us there at a private observatory in a day or so. A woman named Gabrielle Flammarion owns the place. She is waiting for us.

Phaeton watched what he predicted would happen as it slowly did. Cori and Zélie looked at each other. He knew what was coming.

"It is about two hundred and sixty kilometers to Juvisy-sur-Orge.

Zélie turned slightly, edging towards Cori. Her arms pinned straight down, as if to keep her hands from her hips.

"Phaeton, I have to go south.

Cori's voice was small. Phaeton had known it was coming. She looked distraught. It was a moment.

"Let's just get to Beaune.

Zélie had set her jaw. Cori nodded slightly. Phaeton yearned for a dark sky to observe.

They would keep the car and go hell-bent for Beaune. Seventy kilometers west. With luck, they could do it in two to three hours on the country roads. Once again Zélie took the wheel and floored it.

Five or six kilometers outside the city a car pulled on the road behind them. It caught up rapidly. Phaeton was driving. Zélie had finally tired to the point she reluctantly let go the shifter. Cori leaned over the front bench. They were all looking back and in the mirrors. It was worrisome.

"That can't be them, right?

Zélie didn't sound one hundred percent sold.

"What are the odds?

Phaeton was grim.

At that moment they rounded a corner and passed a |sûreté| motorcycle. While black Peugeots were common, they fit the description. Three young people. Driving fast. Heading away from Besançon. Phaeton assumed the bike would turn around. Meanwhile, the car.

"You're both going to look for Georges, aren't you?

They nodded. His teeth hurt.

"Yes. I have to know. I have be sure.

Cori spoke quietly. She was so still, even as the car around her leapt roughly forward.

>1951 - A hard landing at Aboukir

In the last moments, as the Buckmaster hurtled at the edge of Egypt, Colonel Russ Noshunse was oddly preoccupied with the thought of his lost breakfast. It had been interrupted by Bernard Lovell's mysterious call only a week prior. Time flies.

Out of the bomber's windscreen, a thin rectangle of flaming oil in the distance marked the start of the improvised Aboukir landing strip. Flames from the engines rushed towards flames on the ground. It all brought toast to mind. His housekeeper would have long since mopped up the microfluidics without comment. A shame really. Toast really did feel like just the thing at that moment. Hot. With honey. And butter. He would gladly have had a bite.

In all the smoke and darkness, they had no idea if the landing gear was locked down. Or if it was even still attached to the bucking fuselage. The controls were on Rabaha Zayani's station, the trainee yoke. Undercarriage position indicator, selector lever, emergency switch, air pressure gauge, and warning light. All were clearly described in the Pilots Notes. All were functioning about as well as the HVAC controls at Stonehenge. She had gone aft to find a torch and check on Cas Corter and Phaeton. The intercom was down.

Cas was busying himself from place to place. It seemed like he had a great many things to attend to. In reality, after a few seconds of observation, Rabaha realized he was just putting a good face on being shaken wall-to-wall as a human pinball. Gashes on his head had reopened. She checked on the tail carriage. It seemed to be up. She began cranking it down. The handle snapped off, rusted through. She threw it in annoyance, almost hitting Cas. Portuguese apologies flew over her shoulder as she clambered back to the cockpit.

"We will be landing on our belly. The belly flop!

Noshunse didn't look.

"We still have a belly to flop?

The nose was porpoising violently. A sucking noise howled up from the back. Noshunse assumed the star sighting portal where the top turret would have been on an armed airframe was gone. They were half a mile offshore when the left engine spat and died. He guessed they were at less than two thousand feet.

In the back, their final approach was accompanied by Phaeton thrashing. Strapped to the gurney and comatose, he couldn't know what was coming. Nevertheless, his body reacted furiously. First Cas backed away to avoid being punched in the nose. Then one of the gurney's belts split with a crack. Cas flung himself over the gurney using his body to hold Phaeton down. He expected a hard landing.

At less than four hundred feet the right engine threw a rod and exploded. The wing was on fire. It cracked and tore, then snapped off as the plane went into a corkscrew dive. The centripetal force slammed Rabaha into the windscreen. Both sides of the center post warped and blew out. Noshunse couldn't see her. His head collided with a strut, smashing through its suddenly corroded center. It also blew out. Immediately the ceiling of the cockpit buckled and began peeling off in chunks. He was too dazed to apprehend the race between disintegration and impending explosive deceleration.

On the ground, confusion. The landing strip fires were out of control. A monstrous flaming air-hulk was careening down. Airmen and sappers ran. Some had more presence of mind than others. Those ran towards the water. Away from the munitions dumps lurking at the edges of the field under camouflage nets. There was shouting.

After its right-wing snapped the Buckmaster's corkscrew trajectory veered laterally. The left-wing caught the air. It briefly lifted the airframe from one side and rotated it up and back around its new center of mass. The H-tail threw a right hook at the Earth and missed. Then the left wing rose like a sail, caught the wind, and healed the nose of the airplane abruptly up to port. The accelerating yaw spun the remaining wing into a deep uppercut haymaker that caught a piece of the ground.

The plane went into a hypnotizingly overcranked stop-motion tumble. A runaway cartoon wagon wheel bounding across the weedy flats. Throwing spokes and shedding its iron tire. With each rotation less of a plane and more of a cracked disk of fire. It piled right into the netting and tents.

Nine hundred odd seventy-five-millimeter shells were palletized in three locations along the spine of the peninsula. Each location also housed a dark-green short-barreled Pack Howitzer M1. Called Mules One, Two, and Three by the men who man-hauled them into place. With the shells and field guns, thousands of fifty caliber BMG rounds, Browning M2s, M1A1 Bazooka shaped-charge grenades, and other sharp-edged sundries. Tents, radios, generators and their fuel bladders, and lights. These three fire nests were positioned to defend the point and beaches, the center line field, and the width of the landward approach. They were not neat, well-architected fortifications. They were large piles of high explosives waiting to be better handled.

For the center field armaments, that would never happen. Twenty thousand pounds of melting aerospace aluminum cartwheeled directly into the ordinance pyramid. The Buckmaster's remains launched straight up in a gigajoule blast that knocked bystanders down half a mile away. Burning detritus blew across the spit towards the mainland. Twenty seconds later an improbably errant white phosphorus round drilled into the city-side artillery nest eleven hundred yards away. It and a nearby fuel depot lit the sky in a spasm of six close-spaced shocks that mauled the ground. All of Alexandria felt the explosions. No one close to Aboukir could hear the screaming, or anything else.

"
How did Colonel Noshunse, Rabaha, Cas, and Phaeton survive? Rabaha, quite well, actually. She blew out of the cockpit in a lacerating hale. From there she improbably missed the H-tail, was carried downfield in the wind and crashed into a large field officers' tent that had been given over to storing parachutes, camouflage netting, aircraft tarps, inflatable landing craft, and other creative uses of ballistic nylon. She bounced up bruised and covered in blood from superficial cuts, but smiling wickedly and ready to ride the ride again.

Noshunse had no business surviving. Inexplicably, he did. The nosecone and frame of the cockpit broke free and became an inert bouncing bomb that skittered toward a line of tents and light jeeps. After several hops, the repeated insults smashed the aluminum frame and threw him in a terminal arc that crashed through a tower of litters outside a makeshift field hospital still in a state of being unpacked. Slamming into a surprised group of splints-, forceps-, glue-, and morphine-wielding corpsmen saved his life.

In twenty minutes Noshunse was unrecognizable. A deranged white mummy that couldn't be restrained. Hopped up on amphetamines, opiates, and adrenaline. Assembled with orthopedic wraps, staples, and immobilizers. His weak voice yelled for crutches and a torch. He staggered towards the largest fires.

"Bloody hell's fucking bells! Somebody get me a sodding jeep!

Noshunse was reduced to a commanding gasp that didn't carry as far in the commotion as he thought.

"I have to see a dead man about an apocalyptic horse, now!

And then suddenly, Rabaha was there. She limped brightly out of the smoke and distant crackle of small arms fire. She tapped her watch as if it still cared about time.

"I've been waiting around for you for like hours.

Noshunse looked at the blood-covered pixie tapping her feet, tried to answer, and almost threw up. Which would have hurt.

"You lazy bones. Catching a nappy? Let's go, tiger!

They hobbled into a volcanic landscape towards rapidly escalating pounding thuds and crushing waves of heat. Two hundred agonizing yards later they were standing at the edge of a crater at least one hundred feet across, and growing.

"How deep do you think it is?

The man beside Noshunse jumped and almost fell into the glowing pit.

"Hey low! Major Russ! Not dead yet! I sure death ate dinner, finally. You, sir, nuts and guts! But I fly better! Next time I fly you.

Rabaha glared at Har skeptically.

"No way, I flying next time. Thanks to offer.

Noshunse grabbed Har's arm.

"It's Colonel now. Stick to cars. Where's your wheels? Rabaha, Har. Har, Rabaha. Let's go. We have work.

Rabaha was on her knees looking down into the roiling pit.

"What about Phaetonie?

Noshunse spun Har around by grabbing his arm and half falling.

"Dead, maybe. More likely, not dead. In which case, we may well be dead soon. Har, wheels! Raby, with me!

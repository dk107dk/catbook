The Past

"Who am I?

Every few seconds somewhere in the wide world a young woman asks herself this question. The right answer, of course, is: |I am me|. The questioners more often tell themselves one of an untold number of half truths, such as: |I am not you|, |I am not afraid|, |I cannot stop being...|, and so forth.

My great grandmother, Zolacurée Ashlar, called Cori, told herself many stories about who she was. A story's truth is simply if it must be told. True or not, Cori's stories had the truth of needing to be told |by her| to |herself|. She was the girl who says |I am me|.

My truth is that I am Echo. I am not afraid. And I have time to tell the essence of Cori's truth. Approximation by approximation. One story flowing into another. Truth, by definition, has perspective. Both her's and mine.

"
So then. In 1951 in the pretty village of Homes Chapel, a quiet corner of Cheshire, England, the past was ever present. Things that are ever present become subtle. Until the moment they are not.

In that moment, Zolacurée Ashlar's neck prickled. The bare bulb hanging above her swayed all but imperceptibly as the yellowed newspaper she held rocked her world. She sat on the edge of an open sea chest. The whole dusty attic held its breath. The paper said Cori's mother, Ester Ashlar, née de Saulcy, wife of a Besançon University professor, was found dead on the streets of Cairo in the disorder of a food riot twenty years prior.

Cori had only just turned sixteen in May.

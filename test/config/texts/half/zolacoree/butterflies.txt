Greater Manchester never became a hotbed of miniaturized machines. It had esteemed artificers, artisans, engineers, and terotechnologists aplenty. However, the town favored large scale, high volume, and heavy stock. This bent relegated many technical arts, including watchmaking, into subcultures. Such relegation has its place. Industrial clusters push the state of the art. Subcultures invent new arts. Cori's parents were lauded among the long tail of the watchmaking equivalent of prosperous alchemists.

However, Cori had left Manchester. She had arrived in Besançon, the French capital of time. Home of tens of thousands of highly skilled craftsmen, machinists, industrial designers, and horologiographers. Dodane, LIP, Cartier. The big time. You might think she would be dazzled to walk among such talent. Instead, Cori exited |Gare de Besançon-Viotte| with a nonchalant smile. Buzzing prettily about her, a cloud of precious metal drones that would make a master watchmaker pass out in disbelief.

How could that be?

You see, Cori was not like you and me. She lived in an extreme world of ångströms and femtoseconds. In our reality, someone always has to be the extreme. As a rule of thumb, though, generally, it's not you. In Cori's case, however, it |was| her.

For a long time Cori assumed others saw the same mysteries she did. Only later did she realize how different different people are. It took still longer for her to realize the lonely scale of the bell curve she dimly saw in the distance.

How did her unusual abilities come to be? As is often the case, ultimately it came down to genetics. Of a particular kind. As beings, we aren't entirely preordained in the coupling of sperm and egg. Some bits of us are post-ordained at runtime in the molecular machinery of the cells. A day-to-day phenomenon that is with us in every moment we eat, sleep, and breathe. By degrees, in everything we do.

In Cori's case, the things she did included working beside her parents. She joined them in the microscale at an age before she could unthinkingly be left to fend for herself in another room. Her young cells adjusted to the influences of an unusual household. Nurture applied to the genetic shifts piled up by generations. Shifts of a magnitude usually forced by predation or cataclysm were forced in a modest house in Holmes Chapel. The pressure was fantastic. First words, baby teeth, .3mm diamond chisel. An encouraging coo. Loving feedback. Then, surprise! One day a whole new sun rises.

The phenomenon of abrupt discontinuous change in biological systems comes from a fractal confluence. Of course it does. In nature, nothing is simple. Simple things are even more unnatural than nature's extremes. And it is combinatorial complexity that naturally gives rise, occasionally, to a Cori. Calling her one in a million would be an understatement bordering on falsehood.

The day to day contortions of the elements of being is epigenetics. The self our DNA's genes express is dynamically stable. Genes are, in combination, less like a blueprint than like a software program running on proteinene random access memory operated by its user, the body, through the mouse, keyboard, and monitor of epigenetics-mediated transcription. All software has bugs. All epigenetics offers surprises. And some surprising epigenetic changes are otherworldly.

Through the filter of epigenetics, genes become templates for all the various proteins a body needs. Proteins self-assemble into cells. Bodies are made up of innumerable types of cells. Each type is repeated billions and billions of times. In the never-ending construction project that is a human, a billion is a small number. Making each of those billions just a little bit better would sum up to a big difference.

Some of those better billions were Cori's eyes. And those cells were not just a little bit better.

The environmental causes of epigenetics are little-known, even today. Food, sleep, stress, excitement. The electrochemical imprint of a determined life. If specifically mysterious, the whole is certainly tangible. An observer may watch the inexplicable physics of biology smashing into the inscrutable complexity of real life. In the course, a human becomes more. An extreme expression. A subtle new shade of reflected stellar fusion. Boundaries pushed to breaking.

Cori broke many boundaries. Paramount among these, she saw unaided things she should not have been able to see. Her parents were not merely responsible. They were intentional. They actively helped Cori own the infinite. As we have observed down Cori's lineage, one does not casually visit such depths. And so Cori quickly became a creator of worlds at a time when other children were busy exploring their juvenescence as destroyers of toys.

What kind of worlds did little Cori create? She built the kind that could not possibly exist. And then one summer, Cori built a butterfly.

"
That summer there came a lovely morning. An iridescent butterfly fluttered into the house in Holmes Chapel. It was June. The fields were full of flowers. Creatures crawled and flew. The butterfly sailed through the window past Ed's ear. Lamps and loupe on a lazy Saturday. The little bug wafted carelessly through the kitchen. Across the sitting room. Up the stairs. Past Cori's bedroom. Into Ester's world.

There ten-year-old Cori had her own pint-sized station and tools. Lamps, Coddington magnifier, and materials. Quicksilver, wax, wires, and abrasives. The butterfly landed on Cori's forearm as she worked under glass. She felt its feet tapping out hello. She paused her work. She smiled. She inspected her new acquaintance in detail. Having landed, it preened and fluttered. And then abruptly, as Cori watched, it died. It took a moment for Cori to understand this. Then, quiet tears.

Butterflies do not have a long shelf life. They are beautiful and temporary. In leaving life, that one left Cori a gift of a problem to solve: how does one extend beauty beyond the finite? Older and wiser humans have pondered that problem with few new results over thousands of years. That never stopped anyone from trying. Least of all little Cori.

Unsurprisingly, Cori reached a result. She undertook to reconceive the delicate insect in sterner stuff. In time, she succeeded. And the work accelerated. Innovation and improvement come easier than the initial invention. By her fifteenth birthday, she had released a cloud of metal miracles that would baffle those lucky enough to dissect individual examples.

The arc of their wings was entirely natural. The ceramic stochastic foam bodies flexed and vibrated. Cori had invented ways to weave strands of carbon into the grain of metals. Ferrous threads formed into gossamer. No weight of hinges. No mass wasted on interstitial mediums, unnecessary hairs, reproductive systems, cellular membranes, immune defenses, or digestion. Streamlined!

Instead, increased volume given to muscle fiber bundles and elastic tendrils. Energy capture and transmission. Microturbines for regenerative absorption. Undulating edges to actuate piezoelectric ribbon transmitters. Chemical capacitors wrapped by pyroelectric crystals recirculating flex heat into static charges. An energy density unheard of.

Who has time to think up such impossibilities? You ask? The massively warped neurons of Cori's Mutneferet nature and Ashlar nurture had abundant time to conceive the inconceivable. And the patience to build it. Of course she did. She had all the time in her world.

The butterflies were an exercise in controlled flight. Flight patterns transcribed into clockwork disks with infinitesimal bumps and channels interpreted by tiny magnetic probes. Gyroscopes within gyroscopes. A mechanical altimeter shrunk down to an invisibly fine subsystem. The metallic insects swarmed. Continuously adjusting to the closeness of their comrades and to high-powered magnetics embedded in the jewelry worn by their animating mind.

Cori's metallic insect air armada surfed the light and wind. Their descents powered their ascents. They glided thermal differentials and updrafts. Tiring, they eventually lighted on Cori's extremities and tangled in her hair. Their wings pulsed among her locks and sweater pills as she walked. In fluttering, they captured the energy to launch again into orbit. Cori shimmered with their darting sparkles and blurs.

And it was in this way that Zélie's eyes were first captured. Captured by a forlorn girl shimmering on the steps of the |Collège Victor Hugo|. The glistening air, not the shoe polish letters on cheap card stock she held up to passersby. Rough black letters drawn in frustration. Cori's cry for recognition in a city of useless phone books, closed doors, expensive restaurants, and cold nights.

Then the letters rotated into view. They resolved. And they yanked Zélie involuntarily from her path. The world dimmed in the abrupt pull focus of recognition.

"de Saulcy

Heedless of traffic horns, Zélie made a beeline towards the butterflies.

A shy look, a few words. Coffee and croissants for a starving vagrant. They spoke French. They looked similar. After just a few hours they were finishing each other's sentences. That day Zélie met the strangest person she had ever known. She met her inexplicable half-sister, Cori.

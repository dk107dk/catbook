>1951 - Les Défenseurs at Besançon Observatory

Thierry Louis Hrique left a tall glass of water on the windowsill. Associates, interns, and students noticed its prominent position. While his desk kept busy, no one had ever seen Hrique touch the glass. Its level changed imperceptibly. But for clockwork movements, the water offered the most constant and consistent motion in the room. No one guessed that the water was there simply to be quiet.

That was because no one knew Hrique's ears rang. Constantly. Particularly the left one. It had begun two summer's previous. Yet another young Astro had shown the worrying signs: obsession, distraction, guilty stealth in the night. Hrique had confronted the fellow late one night at the equatorial. The conversation had become heated. The man swung the finely balanced telescope hard into Hrique's head, stunning him. Since then, the ringing. A small price to pay in the defense of real time.

That morning, Hrique paused. He gazed into the water's smooth stillness for a brief respite. A simple error correction protocol for his cochlear nerve.

Across from his desk, a mid-height enameled Fichet safe served as an end table. A glass-globe brass lamp sat on top. The safe was mounted on an unobtrusive vibration-damping platform. In it, Thierry kept various precious materials, movements, and a few special chronometers. Among the latter, three hack pocket watches. He set them daily.

One hack watch tracked Paris Time from the Time Lab's telegraph-linked regulator. Hrique set the second hack from the Meridian Building's regulator. The third he set to the Rugby Clock signal at ten a.m. each morning.

Hrique's desk had a telephone. At that time, it was not common to have one's own telephone. The campus had three, total. Whenever he needed additional surety, he could get a time tone from Switzerland or Germany in a few operator-assisted moments. In this way – watches, radio, phone – Hrique maintained an elaborate error correction protocol for time. Though laborious, it was significantly robust to a good granularity.

That Saturday, Hrique had gotten to his office much earlier than usual. He had a bad feeling. The hack watches had failed to slow over two weeks. Their lack of error was significant. Chronometers lost time. That was a given. How much time they lost was the whole point of the Observatory. The Observatory didn't fundamentally observe stars. And it didn't observe time. It observed the heat-loss to precision from uninvestment in the equipment built to manufacture the human perception of time. Observed it and corrected it.

Through that observational focus, Hrique was seeing something that he had never personally seen. Since winter's end, his three hack watches had steadily improved their accuracy. It began so, so subtly. And yet, recently it seemed a tipping point had passed. Subtlety had gone out the window. These things were said to snowball. If he waited any longer could it become |une crise incontrôlable|?

He just didn't know. All Hrique had to go on was a half-deciphered journal, his own observations, and whispers from overseas. Those sources he correlated with local police reports and the papers of academics too obtuse to apprehend what they occasionally encountered. The horological world assumed the experimental setup was flawed. He himself had second-guessed his impossible measurements for too many days. Existential risk quietly grew.

The Observatory had seen all this before. He never had. He felt a growing chill.

The sun rose. His stomach gnawed. There were birds. Hrique stared into the water. Three hundred and sixty-five delicate gradation lines were carved into the one hundred and forty millimeters of internal height with micrometer precision. In time, the building woke up. There were voices out front and steps below. They had arrived. Hrique's sixth sense hadn't been wrong.

Aubert's voice below. Steps up and out. Hrique buzzed the lab.

"Sir, you called. What can I do for you?

Aubert looked distracted.

"The visitors. They were with the director?

Hrique tried to sound casual.

"Non. The two summer associates and Zélie. I think they are heading for Astronomy. I don't know what they plan to do. Perhaps just showing one of them around?

Aubert looked like he wasn't sure about something.

"Sir, one of them – One of the girls; I'm not sure which – I'm pretty sure I heard something odd. Maybe. Ce n'est peut-être rien.

Hrique looked at him sharply.

"Out with it. What did you hear?

Did Aubert look embarrassed?

"I thought I heard "de Saulcy". They spoke too quietly to be sure.

Aubert trailed off. Then regrouped.

"I asked you about the rumors years ago. You told me to mind my own business.

Hrique struggled. He got it out without too much gravel in his throat.

"And I meant it. I want you to check the current batches. All of them. Bring me the results right away. Do it now. And get someone to go make sure we know where the visitors are.

Hrique was already on the phone by the time Aubert's steps faded into the microscopic echos of a short hall with no soft materials.

"This is an urgent call. Get me 3551. If no answer, 3152 or 1162. Ring me back at once.

He needed more than Aubert. He needed operatives with privileged knowledge and no compunctions. Hrique was more intuitive than most metrologists. His intuition had smelled smoke for weeks. Now it was on fire.

Hrique swung round in his chair to a heavy oak cabinet such as you might see in a prosperous farmhouse. Pulling a key chain from his neck, he unlocked it, pulled the door wide, and yanked a dark shawl from a boxy shape. Then he paused. He stood, reached to the office door, and shut and locked it.

The Loral Terracom AN/PRC-1 was known as the suitcase radio. It was an Office of Strategic Services issued set. American. Only a few thousand were made during the war. It sent and received with transcontinental power. Hrique had only ever used it to listen for the Rugby time tone from England. Now he would transmit.

A PRC-1 would not typically be found in a small provincial research organization director's office. How it came to be there is a long story. Let's just say that a certain Worshipful Company of Clockmakers had over the centuries made powerful, paranoid friends with cool technical toys. Horologists are a cliquish bunch. Occasionally they set aside jealousy, competition, and trade secrets in the interest of preserving life on Earth.

Hrique powered it up. As the tubes warmed he set the frequency and plugged in the Morris code keyer. This method of communication was even less familiar than the telephone. The few times he had practiced radio, he had found it painfully slow. Nevertheless, his expectation was that London's reaction would be rapid. Soon he was painstakingly tapping out a request for backup. He hoped his intuition was not wrong.

Not long after, Hrique's phone began ringing.

"
Zélie led Cori and Phaeton out the back of the Equatorial Coudé. The building was narrow and tall. Its back stuck out of the hill and exposed two levels that were almost invisible from the front. Over these, it stair-stepped forward. One step up to the offices. Once more to get to where the coudé had originally been mounted.

They exited a small door on the lowest floor. It opened onto the bridle path below the campus. The air was warm. The grass was tall. Grasshoppers and crickets had gone to war. Their tension lessened as they ambled clockwise below the buildings towards the road. Coming to a stile at the crossing of Avenue de l'Observatoire they decided to slip across and eat lunch at the |cadran solaire analemmatique|, an unusual type of sundial laid out in a parkland across from the Observatory campus.

"Let me see the journal. Who wrote this?

Zélie had dropped to the grass with a baguette. Cori took out the "borrowed" journal from Philippe's office. Zélie grabbed it without asking. Unperturbed, Cori quietly turned to doing something inscrutable with blurred fingers. Phaeton worked on a sandwich, pretending to not watch Cori.

"Oh, look. It was written by one Georges Juan Marat. That we now know is Jacques de Saulcy. Dear Papa. Nice of the Director to lend it you.

They were quiet for a few minutes. Soon enough Zélie's baguette lay on the grass with the ants. Cori was lying on her stomach. Every few minutes launching a speck of sunlight into the air. Phaeton turned on his back. Arm over his eyes. Apparently dozing.

"Listen to this. They found Gruey's body about noon. He was shot sometime the evening before. They couldn't fix a time of death. You know why? Uh? He had already decomposed!

Cori slowly looked up from her work.

"What do you mean "already"?

Zélie flipped the journal's pages, reading furiously.

"No. Not decomposing. He was already gone! All they found was his skeleton. They identified him by his teeth and his wedding ring. Even his clothes were gone.

Her voice trailed off and got small.

"No way. Ca doit être de des conneries!

Cori was done releasing her fleet to do whatever she was readying them to do. She reached for the book. Zélie slowly let it go. She recovered her ant-garnished baguette.

The book was thick black leather. Worn. Hand stitched. The clasp was tarnished brass. Embossed with the viper marque. The text block was gilt-edged. It was the sort of journal that was to the academic emeritus as a gold watch to the retiring engineer. It had about two hundred pages.

"A bunch of it is in code. Are you good with codes?

Cori was good with codes. She was already tearing the code apart. She had time.

At that moment, Aubert suddenly appeared. An elephant could have snuck up on them. Aubert wasn't even trying.

"Hey guys, found you! What's going on?

This was the overly friendly Aubert from the night before again. Phaeton opened a wary eye. He assumed Aubert was a linearly dependent vector. Dependent on what wasn't clear.

"You were looking for us? We are lunching. Or we were. Now we're post-lunching. Sadly Cori was so hungry she ate your sandwich.

Phaeton yawned as he spoke. He wasn't actually sleepy just then. It just seemed like a good defensive ploy to his basal ganglia. Aubert wasn't deterred. He didn't like sandwiches. He fished in his pocket furiously. Pulled out a pen. It flashed in the sun. Copper and gold. Blackwood grip. The nib was a custom millimeter |Société Bic| ballpoint.

"We found this in the Time Lab under a bench. It looks expensive. It's engraved "de Saulcy". Anybody recognize it?

Cori moved to speak. Zélie, brain on fire, leapt in.

"Give it here. De Saulcy is our father's name. What bench was it under?

Aubert did a credible job of controlling his facial expression. Zélie, less so. She almost swallowed her tongue. In one sentence she had said two things she shouldn't have.

"The back one near the vibration table. Probably it shook loose. Is it yours?

Zélie was mute. She had a gray look on her face that made her look quite different.

Phaeton tried saving the day.

"It looks like one I saw the director using the other day. Perhaps it's his?

Aubert seemed eager to get on with whatever errand he was on.

"Probably it is. Or he'll know who should have it. Anyway, I'm off. See you later?

They assured him they would. He left in a hurry. Nobody noticed the tiny shiny scrap of foil that had gotten tangled in his hair. Once he was gone the threesome pulled together and lowered their voices.

"I bollocksed that up, though, didn't I? Je suis un idiot!

Cori had open pages of neat block-lettered code. She pointed. Zélie and Phaeton looked. They had odd expressions because, how?

"This is written by Georges. He tells about les Défenseurs Du Temps Constant.

She flipped furiously.

"And this is about the Tempora Mutatori. He says he never was able to contact them. They may be a myth.

She looked up. Eyes big.

"But the les Défenseurs sound a bit scary.

Zélie felt like she was being left out of a secret. She was turning from embarrassed to cranky. A natural progression.

"How the heck can you read that? That's nonsense! Where is it written?

Cori spoke simply but her eyes crinkled.

"The best explanation for how I can read this is actually written in there. I'll need a few minutes with a pencil to get that for you.

Zélie snorted in a crabby way that wasn't entirely disagreeable.

"Little brat! You little liar.

Zélie looked like she would have smacked her sister in the arm if she had actually known her longer than about a week.

"We may be having our first dispute de soeurs.

Phaeton leaned in, amazed to find himself the most focused person in the conversation.

"Does the little book tell us what to do next? I feel like we're in the middle of something we don't understand, we can't see, and it's spinning out of control. I don't know about you, but I don't believe that after twenty years that fabulously expensive pen that nobody knows just happened to roll out from under a table this morning.

He wasn't wrong about that. Let's go back an hour or so.

Thierry Hrique hung up his phone by all but throwing it at the cradle. Stepped to the door. Unlocked it. Hollered for Aubert. He grabbed the shawl from the floor and threw it over the PRC-1. Aubert arrived running, pale.

"Oui, chef. What do you need?

Hrique looked annoyed.

"Where are you with the chronometers? Is there or isn't there anything to report?

Aubert cringed.

"I'm almost done. I was just double-checking everything. It's a mess.

Hrique's eyes narrowed.

"It's all over the place. Distortion. Decay. Several cases. Some are a few minutes slow. Maybe up to an hour. Others are fast. Many are completely unwound. And...

Aubert's eyes were wide. He held up a notepad with Xs, numbers, and scribbles.

"There was one tray. It was bad. I don't understand.

Hrique's face couldn't get harder. His jaw clenched.

"What. Did. You. See.

Aubert looked up abruptly. It was hard to tell if he was scared of Hrique, what he saw, or something else.

"One of the chronometers. It was a shell. The movement collapsed. The case crumbled when I touched it. You know the Antikythera Mechanism? Like that!

He gulped air. Then, a voice over the edge.

"What the fuck was that?! What's going on?

Hrique slapped him hard. He jammed the larger man up against the wall roughly with his forearm on Aubert's neck. It was an action unmistakable in its hint of further violence.

"Get your shit together, boy. You hear me?

They momentarily paused at the tip of the power differential-driven escapement's swing. Then, reversing, unwinding, Hrique straightened Aubert's collar.

"Give me that.

He indicated the notebook.

"Get Frère Michel here. He should bring his tools. I want him to engrave something. Quickly. If he's not there find someone else who can. I'll explain later. You can make a difference today. Go.

Aubert left moving quickly. Hrique threw the notebook and slammed the door. The radio would overheat. The phone rang. He was suddenly out of breath. The phone wouldn't stop ringing. His head hurt.

They said if the atomic bombs were coming you should get to the lowest floor and huddle in a doorway. They also said it would do no good at all. What do you do if eternity is ending? He didn't know. They don't say anything about that. Doesn't matter, he supposed, nothing would do any good at all. Still, he had to try.

"
Frère Michel thumped Hrique's door. He was a big man who looked like a farmer. One hand carried a large and battered bag of tools. The other, a table vice. He wore run-down field boots that carried a slug of mud in a split in the sole at the toe. Mud on his pants. Mud was the calling card of this brute craftsman. A slovenly person, his chaotic abode, a careless workshop, and vulgar tastes all belied his work's elegance. He stood mute and stared.

In his youth, son of a farmer and nephew to a clockmaker, Frère Michel had a lamb. His father said he should not befriend it. His mother said she didn't feed pets. One day, Frère Michel's father's veterinarian said that the growing sheep would have to be put down. It had incurred an infection in one of its forelegs. The pastern and fetlock.

Young Michel was distraught. He sought the advice of his father. That didn't go well. He ended up pleading with his father not to immediately put the animal down for |le gigot d'agneau|. Having begged a reprieve Michel ran to his uncle's workshop. He was used to having the run of the place. Young Michel had several unfinished projects under various benches and bins. His uncle ignored the boy as Michel began crafting a solution to his lamb's troubles.

A few hours later Frère Michel piled his tools, some wire and hardware, and the parts of his creation into a canvas. He sprinted back a mile and a half to the farm, panting under the load. The light was fading. Grabbing a lantern and stool he set up his workspace in the barn. He pulled water and lit a small stove. He laid out his tools. As he did he crooned to the worried, sick lamb. He called it |tête floue| and |côtelette de bébé|. And he got to work.

That night Frère Michel's parents pulled the shutters and shut the windows. Their fire popped and snapped. They had, as usual, worked long hours. Tired, they were well able to tune out the sounds from the barn. They slept well.

At morning's first light Michel's father walked into the yard. He stopped before the barn. Soft sobbing. Anger rising that his son might be crying over lamb chops, he threw the door open. Frère Michel was fast asleep. Propped up in the hay. Sleepy smile on his face.

In the middle of the floor, the lamb sobbed and gasped. A dying child. Its right hind leg kicked weakly. Thick blood congealed everywhere. Chunks of meat and bone. The animal's unnatural forelegs stuck stiffly before it.

A matching pair of iron and coin-metal limbs shivered immotively. Delicate bronze leaves flexed into graceful sinews. Curling iron link rods connected to sprung hinges. Sharpened sheepsfoot blades mounted on miniature horseshoes. The whole welded to ball and cup wagon hitches and tightly wire-bound to the scraped-bare shoulder bones.

Frère Michel's father took one look at the beautifully matched metal forelimbs sticking out from the tortured animal. He sucked through his teeth. Grabbed a rusted iron hitching post. Lifted it high and brought it down square on the victim's head. Frère Michel woke to the thump and new blood splattering on his face. His father turned without a word and walked out to attend to a farmer's daily chores.

"
Hrique handed over the pen and gave instructions. Frère Michel set up his tools at an inexpressive pace. Hrique turned back to the phone. Not long after, letters were cut. Aubert was summoned to the doorway to learn his lines. He had already spotted the group picnicking on the analemmatic sundial. Off he hurried with the pen. Then they waited. It was Saturday quiet. No one moved. The phone rang again and again.

On the parkland, Aubert was long gone. They delayed and deliberated. Zélie argued to keep her mind distracted. Phaeton argued lazily, giving Cori time to read. He had not yet taken onboard how little anyone had to worry about Cori's access to time. The orvietan afternoon sun wore off.

They decided to retrace their steps to return the diary and see what more Philippe could tell them. Eventually, they would have to return to Chronometry for their things. That seemed like a vaguely hostile environment. Getting more intel first seemed like the smart move. They resolved to lure Philippe to dinner. Finally, they stood and approached |Avenue de l'Observatoire| across from the horse path circling campus.

A car approached. Zélie waved them back behind a grey willow. It sped past. Slammed on its brakes, fishtailing in the gravel. It turned into the Observatory's lane. They watched it drive too fast round the circle and halt in the orchard behind Chronometry. Car doors thumped in the distance. The group skittered across the road. They jumped the stile and moved furtively down the horse path. No one spoke. Phaeton kept his head low.

It was past mid-afternoon. Much of the path was in shadow. Behind the Meridian Building were two smaller Astro buildings backed up to the bridle path. Both had been instrument workshops. The first windows showed a dim world of clock-drive star trackers, telescope calibration hardware, an old dividing engine, lathes, and the like.

The other building had originally been an optical shop. It had once been capable of casting crown and flint glass disks, polishing them to lenses, and cementing them into bespoke achromatic refracting objectives. Those days were long past. Zélie on tiptoes spied cobwebs, desks, filing cases, and chalkboards. Ancient equipment was heaped in a darkened back room. There was nobody. They moved on.

Below the Equatorial Coudé building, the group pulled together and looked for signs of life. There were no crickets or birds. It was quiet, but for the wind.

They entered. Inside they found the light string and pulled it. The bulb stayed dark. They were in a narrow hall with storage space on one side and a small room full of shadows on the other. Ahead of them was the staircase they had come down earlier in the day, now darkened. They went up.

The stairs came up at the back of the building, right by Philippe's office. They could immediately tell something was wrong. Zélie verbalized. Cori gasped. Phaeton was grimly silent.

"Nom de dieu! What the hell?!

The door to Philippe's office was torn off its hinges. It rested precariously between the wall across from the doorway and a large bookcase. The bookcase had been cleared to the floor. The books were tangled up in a curtain, long dead long-stemmed flowers, knickknacks, a smashed hobbyist's telescope, and birthday cards.

It was as if Philippe had lured a whirlwind to enter with instructions to destroy. The window was shut. A picture frame dropped to the floor. Everyone jumped at the smash.

"Bloody hell. We n... Shhhh!

They froze. A car engine. A shout. The noise stopped. Distantly, a door slammed.

Cori peeked out the window. She whispered.

"His bicycle is still at the back of the residence. Should we go check?

They ran downstairs looking nervously up the hall to |la salle équatoriale| and the front door. At the bottom in the gloom, Zélie held up a hand. They listened. Faint wind. The creaks of seventy-year-old masonry. Their breath.

"Stay low and keep below the path. We'll go up at the corner. Into the kitchen.

Then they ran. Phaeton doubled over. They clambered twenty feet below the bridle path. There was a fainter track through the brambles where others had passed. Their heads were well below the bend of the hill. Zélie skinned a knee. Cori pulled her up. Phaeton piled into them and fell into thorns. They kept going. It was a long hundred meters.

Below the residence, they came up. There was only tall grass between them and the house. The house was between them and the Chronometry Building. However, there was nothing blocking the view from the front of the Equatorial Coudé or the back half of the circle drive. They paused to look at each other.

Nobody was thinking clearly about a day gone mad. Someone violent was on the grounds. They didn't know who. They didn't know where. They didn't know why.

As ever, Zélie led the dash to the kitchen door. It hung unlatched. The inside door was ajar. Just as well. Had that not been the case probably one of them would have knocked. How would that have been a good idea?

Phaeton and Zélie protectively shepherded Cori. At the kitchen door, however, Cori squeaked past Zélie and tumbled in first. The others crowded after. Dim gray sun through unwashed curtains. Zélie and Phaeton saw something amazing.

Cori spun lazily. A child twirling to an unheard melody. Her dark hair lifting off her neck. Her arms moving gracefully. Rising over her head. Following them, a swirl of sparks. Slipping out of her curls. Crepuscular solar flares. Spun into a ball orbit. One by one, peeling away.

She slowed and facing them. Zélie and Phaeton were mouths open, following the traces of Cori's kaleidoscope. Cori paused, head cocked, as if listening.

Suddenly Cori's eyes flew to one of the two doorways. She ran to the hall. Zélie and Phaeton followed. Blackwood floors, dark wainscoting, hickory wallpaper. Up the stairs, oak balustrades and mossy runner. Cori took two stairs at a time.

As she followed Zélie's nose wrinkled involuntarily. Phaeton coughed. Cori pulled to an abrupt halt at the door at the end of the hall. The others piled into her. The smell had become a wall of bad. The room was lit by two narrow windows with raised shades and loose lace curtains facing northeast. Cori walked into the murky space purposefully. The others did not immediately follow.

There was a bed. It had four posts, pillows, comforter. The bedspread was burgundy. The wallpaper was rust. The body spreadeagled was burning away as they stared at it. Its flesh and cloth were dissolving in the roiling solvent of time. Zélie threw up explosively. Phaeton staggered to the window.

Cori leaned in. The corpse's flesh wasn't completely gone. A dull edge had bit bone-deep into the neck. She pulled a tarnished chronometer from the radius and ulna. To no surprise at all, by its still legible engraving, it was Philippe's. Inexplicably, it had stopped early on the following Monday.

Suddenly Phaeton fell backward crashing into a dresser. Coughing and gasping. Picked himself up, gesturing franticly to the hall door. Whispering loudly.

"Someone is coming. From Chronos. Go, go. Out the back.

They scrambled down the hall and back downstairs. Cori's fleet straggled back to her. Thierry Hrique grabbed the front door and rattled its bones. He and Frère Michel stepped heavily in. The air crumpled. Zélie, Cori, and Phaeton slipped out the backdoor without another sound.

They ran. Behind the residence. Behind Chronometry. To the far corner. The one nearest the avenue. Behind the small orchard. There they stopped. A gravel driveway sheltered a small number of cars. A black Peugeot 203 beside a gray Citroën 2CV. Zélie liked the Peugeot. It had greater horsepower.

"Cori, run in and grab our bags from under the first bench of the Time Lab. I'll start the car.

She looked into Cori's eyes. Willing her to be Ok with the mission.

"They don't know you. Act natural. Hurry.

They ran. Phaeton stood guard at the door of the car. Zélie leaned under the dash. She worked the wires. The engine started. Phaeton was in the backseat. Zélie backed up and turned counterclockwise to point the car towards the avenue.

A moment later Cori dashed out. Phaeton leaned over and opened the front passenger door. Cori threw the bags. She tumbled in. He caught her shoulders and pulled her upright, as Zélie gunned the engine. The tires kicked rocks as they sped to the entrance. A moment later they left |La Bouloie| heading south at speed. They had no idea where to.

Not more than two minutes later the Citroën sped after them. Inside, four men with grim faces.

Louis lay his head gently back on the unyielding rest. As with thrones, his perch was uncomfortable, form following function. An inverted labortory bench with the microscope reared against the heavens. From his Crypte aux Ã‰toiles, like a professor of the microscopic he would judge of the resolution of time and space, and characterize the infantessimal.

Louis stared through the smallest glass. His head weighed all but nothing against the press of the cosmos. Five kilograms. The pool his gray eyes floated in. The weight slowly deformed his parietal into a flater plate as the future flooded in.

A few hours later he found himself on the cool cement at the bottom of the well. The chair rising on a scaffold above him. Pinned by the twenty-five-foot brass linticular scribe reaching down from the heavens. Etching the chair. Carving his shadow. Engraving a glactic scale swirl of probabilies into a burr-edged grinding bite. His eyes flattened. His brain ground to a poppy-paste smear spread by a gigantic butter knife of light.

A few hours later still Louis caught a glint of sunlight. It had come a long way to find him. A few photons, a few million miles. The last miles, though. The smashing heat. Cascading headlong through a few hundred miles of the fading starburst brilliance of the le Roi Soleil. Mixing with the glow from the hot stones of Paris. Fluming against the leaded glass and lead mullions. Reflections spackling and vibrating off the brass tubes. A dwindling few braves charging between azmuith knob, focal wing, the tube rings, the cap chains. A glass of spring water. Steel heads and drives of steel screws. His refocusing eyes. Pulling him back to the few tens of millions of miles of spacetime Louis rightfully inhabited most days.

He heaved himself up on one elbow. His head ached. He was used to it. He had no idea what an epigenitic scrambing his brain was taking. Cement. Pressure. Lead and copper. Arscenic. Light and solar pressure. Night and the vacuum of living at the edge of unreality. He pulled himself up by a railing running up the curve of the well. He fell. His head hit the floor thickly and he was still for hours more.

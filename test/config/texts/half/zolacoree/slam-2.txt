Not long after, several kilometers west at Arsenal Quay, Hrique and Aubert were careful to remain out of sight. They observed Cori and Zélie. Members of Cori's aerial armada loitered, observing them. Cori's sparks walked picket well.

"Do you see them yet?

Aubert had field glasses at the porthole. He was sector scanning.

"I don't think so. I see Egyptians. The sisters are near the gate. British and maybe Americans.

Hrique could hear Aubert squinting.

"What are their names again?

The names were Renée Câbleur, Yves Mont du Riverain, and Vartan Roché-Guichard. All little known to Hrique. His call for assistance from the docks at Marseilles had worked. It had worked its way well above his pay grade.

Renée was an agent of a shadowy general trading company descended through interlocking limited partners from the |Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales|. Her star was rising fast. She had had her personal administrator arrange their rendezvous. Vartan, older, was cut from a superficially similar cloth. A boards of directors figurehead of the likes of |Compagnie Cartier| and |Société des Missions Etrangères de Paris|. Hrique had been warned simply: minimize contact with Yves. They would meet the ship. Presumably by air. Despite the foundational role of Besançon in |les Défenseurs|, his all but heritable role in the Observatory, and his instigating forebear, Hrique was both outranked and likely out-gunned.

"They are exiting the gate now.

A large black staff car rolled rapidly down the cobbles along the branch line from the coal wharves to the west. It stopped abruptly at the end of |Le Falaise|'s pier.

"There is a saloon. Looks like from the Consulate, maybe. Several people.

Aubert was intent on focusing.

"Aubert, now. We're going. Take this.

They rushed down to the main deck. Brushed aside stewards. Pushed between officers and deckhands. Hrique made the bricks well ahead of Aubert, who carried their few, small bags. He rushed to the car with diplomatic plates. It opened. Renée gave him no leeway.

"They just left in a local car at high speed. Get in. Gendarmerie is tailing. We think we know where they are headed. There is a disturbance.

She turned, drumming on the steel roof. Her understatement was notable. Aubert rushed up. The driver grabbed the bags. Hrique was already in the car. Renée made an impatient gesture. Aubert moved quickly to board the car. Suddenly Renée pressed a hand on his chest stopping him cold. She picked a glittering foil from behind his collar. Held it up to severe inspection. It flashed and blurred in the dry air. Aubert couldn't tell what it was, but he had an idea. She crushed it, flicked it, and shoved him into the car with force.

The driver applied the horn and drove like his job was forfeit. Donkeys and portage scattered. The gates widened barely in time. Balanced on a rear-facing jump seat, Yves silently loaded a spare clip with bullets from a deep coat pocket.

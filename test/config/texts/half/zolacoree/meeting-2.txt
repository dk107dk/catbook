Cori Ashlar had moved to Holmes Chapel the summer before second form. Edward prevailed in his strenuous efforts to allow her to sit for the Higher School Certificate. That accomplished, she never set foot in a school again. Cori was most often working in her parent's workshops. Or else wandering fields and streams looking for inspiration as to her next creation. She kept to herself and kept herself busy.

Phaeton Athair soon after left Holmes Chapel for Victoria. He and Cori had passed many times on the village streets unaware. When Phaeton was home for Christmas he would again be briefly less than a mile from Cori. Nevertheless, on her first pass, the introverted girl next door missed the daydreaming boy. In Besançon her aim was much better.

"C'est Philippe Messier. He runs the Observatory. Le Grande Directeur.

Zélie waved in an I-don't-think-much-of-him way across the narrow cafe, |La Belle Aurore|.

"He's Astro.

She said it as if it explained anything. Cori looked at her patiently.

"I mean, he's an astronomer. I'm a chronometrician. We Chronos don't mix with Astros. It's a thing here.

Cori didn't find this explanation helpful.

"Yes, but who's the boy?

Zélie cocked a smirking eye.

"Ah, est-ce qu'il remonte-t-il votre chronomètre?

Cori continued fiddling with a mechanical butterfly. Zélie was quickly becoming used to that. With her face bent down it was hard to see Cori smile at Zélie's smartassery. Not expecting an immediate answer Zélie brought up the silver monocular hanging at her neck. Her monocular could be bent into a ninety-degree periscope. She became absorbed in bending, focusing, and ranging. Her coffee cooled. She figured she could give patience a try, too.

The boy in question looked English. Dark blue, open collar. Solid boots. Wavy hair swept back. Leaning forward. Tall. Messier was tightly wound. Zélie saw the boy enunciating. She guessed they were talking about the cosmos, observing it, and the abstruse optics that enabled it. Zélie had enough complications. She was happy to just look away. Cori was not.

"I think we can find out things. Watch.

Cori's gold-foil lepidopteran was on her finger. She waved her hand over her head the way the Queen waves from a motorcar to her subjects. The animatronic insect fluttered off in the halting flight common to moths and butterflies. A cloud of them would have made of the world a wind tunnel of visible currents. This lone creature just bobbed and weaved. A point of light. A metal Tinkerbell. Spoons clinked on coffee mugs.

The explorer floated up on eddies and fell. It lifted energetically in a blur of beats, then rewound as it glided downwards. In about thirty seconds, with a final effort, it landed with an infinitesimal thud on Phaeton's collar. It twitched and preened just out of sight from Messier. Zélie was hypnotized. A trance of admiration and amazement so deep she forgot she had been wondering why Cori had zeroed in on this boy. Cori's magical contraptions continued to floor Zélie.

To all appearances, Cori was floored by the boy.

It is a little known fact that insect hearing is remarkable. Nevertheless, it would clearly be impossible for Cori's mechanical lepidoptera to eavesdrop on Phaeton and Messier and somehow broadcast what it heard back to Cori. Still, just imagine all the things it heard.

"Doc B. thought I might be able to help with your work. But I don't really know anything about it.

Messier pressed the pads of his fingers into the table as if it might react too quickly. Astronomy and chronometry were then largely solitary endeavors. Messier felt their pursuit was weighted towards individuals with unusual degrees of focus and self-absorption. Sincere interest in others' obsessions was not the norm. In Messier's conception, the interests of the "man on the street" paired with those of his chosen cohort would present a very long baseline indeed.

"Very long baseline interferometry, you know of it, yes?

Phaeton did, yes.

"Today, hardly settled science. They are trying to use it in the radio astronomy. In two-telescope setups. One telescope here.

Messier waved his hands expansively.

"And one kilometers away, here. Their signals then combined. It has been tried. So far, results have been, well. Imperfect.

Phaeton had read papers and followed the experiments of those Lovell collaborated with. Messier continued.

"The instruments connect, yes. And improving results on microwave links. Still, mais imparfait. And so far, only radio, not light.

Phaeton knew Lovell's team had concepts using high-resolution time codes on magnetic tape.

"Prof B. thinks we may be able to simply capture the data to tape and exchange it in the mail. If only we can synchronize the time code.

Messier's excitement was growing.

"Qui, perhaps, mais c'est difficile. What if precise synchronization were unnecessary? What if the whole universe is sufficient clock for everyone?

As he spoke more and more rapidly, Phaeton saw Messier's intellect heating up as his words spiralled into a topic with an immense pull. He had an idea of what Messier was after from talking with Lovell and prowling the Rylands and Sackville libraries. The more interesting thing was Messier, himself. Lovell had recommended Phaeton to a man that sounded quite different from the high-energy source pulsing across the cafe table.

"There are possibilities. Two of them. The optical astrometry and, maybe, the radio sources. Do you know the Carte du Ciel?

Phaeton knew the name |Carte du Ciel|. Some names are grand in their banality. There are any number of star maps. Only a star map simply named Star Map could possibly stand out.

"Yes, at least, I've heard of it.

This was a good start. Messier wrapped the answer up and saved it for later.

"Good, good. Just perhaps precision in its geometry of the sky can be used to capture time. As it ever has, but at a higher quality and intertwined for intercontinental metrology.

Phaeton was barely keeping up. The man was apparently exhausting.

"Alternatively, it may be possible that. Well, pas un mot de ça. There may be pulsing beacons. Lighthouses in the heavens. Astronomical time code, if you like. If they exist, and we can find them, rather than calculate the motions to derive the time, the universe will simply tell us the time directly.

Phaeton was in need of more coffee.

"That would be amazing.

Messier appreciated the measured enthusiasm. He had known Phaeton for very few days. It was his nature to project all the friendship and intellectual foment he had with Lovell immediately on one who Lovell recommended. He was in dire need of new collaborators, new ideas. The boy had promise. They could do good work together.

At that point, having heard enough, and rested well, Cori's tiny golden insect detached from Phaeton's collar and began its looping, fluttering journey back to her.

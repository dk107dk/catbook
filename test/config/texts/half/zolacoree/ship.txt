>1951 - Cori, Zélie, Aubert, and Hrique at sea

The same day Phaeton was attacked at Camille Flammarion Observatory, Zélie and Cori reached Marseille.

The mail packet |Le Falaise| was to embark for Alexandria at ten p.m. The sisters had arrived on the waterfront a few hours before. They had ditched the truck on the outskirts that afternoon. The city was crowded. They carried nothing. The sea breeze was cooling. Cori lifted a fisherman's sweater from the backdoor of a cooper. Zélie grabbed a grubby oiled canvas jacket off a nail inside a dock-side produce warehouse.

They looked and felt like dirty farmhands running away to sea. Money was short. Their last francs went for coffee and noodle soup. The cheap cafe they picked seemed popular enough for them to be anonymous. They were tired. A disorderly evening fell all over their mood.

Their options were thin. Stowaway. Find money for tickets. Give up. Giving up was tempting but didn't stand up to inspection. Stowing away was quickly discarded because how does one actually do that? So they needed money. And they needed it quickly. Once the |Le Falaise| left it would be two days before a less direct passage. And they were wanted felons. Their coffee was getting cold.

"I don't have anything to sell. Other than my wonderful self, and that's not happening!

Cori laughed tiredly.

"We don't need to go that far in our life of crime.

She twirled a lock absentmindedly. Something golden flashed momentarily behind her ear. Zélie noticed.

"Would you consider selling one of your... Comment le dis tu? Jewelry?

Cori made a face.

"Fine. Just asking. We can always eat them.

In short order, though, it was the insects that came through. Cori shook her wrists. Bracelets degenerated. Pendant disintegrated. Necklace decomposed. Their antennae surfaced from deep in her hair. They crept into a gossamer pool on the table. It streamed to the edge and tumbled, launched, or crawled out the window and away. Zélie tried to play it cool. Their waitress gasped. A cup shattered. In a moment they were gone. Hunting.

By the time they drank their refills and drained their bladders word from Cori's armada was trickling in. Soon the girls were on the move.

Hrique and Aubert reached the city shortly after the sisters. Hrique frowned. His jaw hurt. Was he looking for a gawky man with two young women or just the women or what? They drove slowly towards |Vieux-Port|.

After several hurried calls from the road, Hrique's seat-of-the-pants guess had been that the girls would follow Georges Juan Marat's trail. |Aéroport Marseille| seemed less likely than the seaport. Hrique feared they would pass the girls unrealized. In fact, they did. Hrique also worried he might be in the wrong city. He was not.

Cori led them several narrow blocks to |Rue du Panier|. The shops were closed. Bars, open. About four blocks of gentle rise brought them to the aptly named |Rue des Pistoles|. They scouted the shop doors. About halfway along they ducked through an alley to the back doors on the claustrophobic |Rue Puits du Denier|. Cori stepped slowly back down to number thirteen. This was where their banditry would happen, pistols or no.

"It's the back of that pawnbroker's. Go to that doorway and keep watch. If anyone tries to go in do something loud to distract them.

She pushed Zélie away and turned to the door. Crouching down in the shadows. A dark opening and then gone. Zélie huddled in the doorway. Nobody. It was as quiet as a city knows how to be at eight p.m. Her watch hammered. Her pulse thumped in her neck and under her ears.

"
Aubert strolled up to the passenger window fronting on the |Messageries Maritimes| wharf. |Le Falaise's| three white masts were brightly lit from below. Red and green points decorated the spars and bridge wings. Her bow roped in about one hundred yards from where he stood.

"I'm looking for two sisters. They are sixteen and twenty. The older one is... about this tall.

He waved his arms approximately. He had been about to say |pretty| but stopped himself.

"Have you seen them? Maybe with a guy, maybe not?

The dock hand at the ticketing window made a noncommittal gesture. He bit down on his cigarette to seat it before speaking.

"Perhaps.

Turning his head he hollered at a person who wasn't really that far away.

"Eh, Door-knocker, didn't you have two girls at the window earlier? When was that?

Aubert brightened.

"Did they get tickets for the mail to Alexandria?

Aubert pointed to the ship without looking.

"Non. They did not.

He reached for a clipboard.

"No new passengers since, maybe, yesterday morning.

The man looked like this was all he had on the topic. He picked up a soggy-looking half-baguette.

"Thanks. Hey, do you still have cabins available for tonight? What if I want to buy four?

The man didn't look up.

"Twenty thousand for third. Thirty-five for second.

Aubert noticed he wasn't quoted first. He reflexively looked down at what he was wearing.

"Merci.

He hustled back to Hrique in the Renault with the good news.

"I think they are here. The girls, at least. They're looking for a passage. Could be out of money.

Hrique tried not to release his breath explosively. It was a long risk played that looked like it would pay out.

"Good. What are their other options departing soon? We need to check them.

Aubert noticed that another look crept onto Hrique's face. It would be too bad if they lost the trail now.

"You stay here and watch. I'll find a phone and see if I can get local reinforcements.

"
Five blocks away Cori suddenly appeared at Zélie's elbow. Her hair sparkled in the dim light of lidded windows.

"We're good. Let's go quickly and get aboard!

Zélie was by that time inured to Cori's inscrutable ways. The two of them dashed up the street and zigzagged back to the |Messageries Maritimes| dock. They rapped on the window and demanded tickets. Cori wanted second class. Zélie insisted on first.

No luggage. Passports in order. Papers signed. No questions. They threaded through stevedores, stewards, and porters. They dodged experienced travelers comfortable coming aboard at the last minute. Their mood lifted as they rose up the gangway. Zélie whistled a breathless Clair de lune. Cori's accompaniment was near perfect.

||Le Falaise| was not a fancy ship. Second class was five small staterooms on second deck. First class was another three berths one deck up. There were a few more crowded bunks lower down in third class. Third was popular in those years. A cargo hauler, not a liner. She had few amusements. First and Second-class travelers could promenade a little. Third-class passengers did not have deck privileges.

The sisters had a small private stateroom. In Second-class they might have shared it with two strangers. In First, it was all theirs. In other respects, it was hard to see a difference. The floor was deep rust-colored enamel. Spotless. Polished. Metal walls, flat eggshell white. The hardware of the two portholes was painted over. The view from one was the sky. The other, the cover of a lifeboat. Two bunks with brown wool blankets over crisp white sheets. A cubby with luggage shelves took up one side of the door. Across sat a sink and mirror. A small table. A lamp. They were high over the water. The number was 303.

In the morning Zélie threw a pillow at Cori. They wandered about till a steward pointed them to breakfast. Then they found a nook out of the wind where they could watch the water go west as they went east. Sardinia was minding its business about one hundred miles to port. The coffee was a bit better than expected. The croissants, somewhat worse.

"How did we get here, then?

Cori didn't respond right away.

"Hey, you. We are on an adventure. And you seem a bit too good at it to be learning on the job.

Still nothing.

"How did you get into that building? Why that one? How much did you steal? In fact, who the heck are you?

This last in a teasing voice. Cori was pretty sure Zélie knew who she was so she just smiled.

"I should tell you a few things, I guess.

Zélie snorted.

"I should think! After all, we're going to be arrested on the dock and serve life sentences breaking rocks in the colonies. I think I deserve to know.

"
The doorway on |Rue Puits du Denier| had been darker even than the street. Cori had leaned in with her head resting on the rough wood. It was oil paint. She felt it crackling under her forehead. A tickle cascaded down her arm against her skin.

Little gems with mesh wings finer than sunlight had tumbled into her cupped hand. She had guided them. Flexes of wrinkles and fingers. The metallic insects reorganized themselves. They formed a slender lock pick fit to pin a queen's twisted crown. She raised it.

It slid smoothly into the keyhole. Inside, the insects bloomed. Wings levered pins against spring-driven drivers. They braced and clicked. Cori pulled the backbone. Origami folds hoisted inorganic spars. Pulvillus, Femur, Tibia, and claws. Snapping, twisting. The instrument warped softly. Impossibly fine hairs found cracks that would have been invisible to the best microscopes of the |Laboratoire de Chronométrie|. With the softest of clicks, the tumbler turned. The door opened.

"
"Look into my eyes, Zel. Regarde profondément.

Cori pulled Zélie's right shoulder around. The younger girl moved the older gently with the control of a watchmaker. She put her sister's hand on her left shoulder. Her head inclined towards Zélie with the look of a little Lauren Bacall. Their eyes locked. Eventually, their foreheads collided softly in a stop-motion simulacrum of Zeno's arrow. The chaotic fractal heat engine that was Cori rose to entangle Zélie's comparatively stratospheric view of the world. And in turn, Zélie's world simply froze.

When their heads slowly separated, Zélie saw a world made of time. She had had no idea.

On the motionless second deck, Aubert looked up-ladder. His stolid face hoping to catch a glimpse of Zélie. An annoyed bark from Hrique had paused in mid-flight. It said Aubert should stay out of sight. The air's sound waves were equally as immobilized as the bow waves lifting striped dolphins. Waves temporarily without depth or velocity.

Hrique's razor-sharp eyebrows couldn't release. His straining neck muscles couldn't relent. An electric pressure peaked and held. The ache plain on his face for inspection. Stepping down from Third, Zélie marveled at his awkward pose. Cori examined him curiously. The girls' eyes smiled at the unintentional physical comedy. They moved on. In the galley, they stole more weak croissants. They drank more strong coffee.

Eventually, the sisters decided third deck was indeed nicer than the others. They returned to their cabin. The wind stirred, revived, and let out its breath. The dolphins blinked and dove. Aubert finished turning to Hrique with a sheepish look. Hrique shut the cabin door crossly. The world moved just as it has always been known to do.

Yet Hrique just stood there, heart dropped. He had had doubts and hopes. Inexplicably, but with certainty, now he knew.

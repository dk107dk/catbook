1951 - Cori and Zélie head south towards Alexandria

They tumbled out of the Peugeot into a ditch. The car spun and sped off from barely a stop. Moments later other wheels skidded around the corner and rushed past. Zélie and Cori backed away staying low. They ran doubled over. There was a farmhouse. An old farm truck occupied the locked barn. Was the house likewise occupied? They hoped not.

There is no such thing as a securely locked barn. The sisters found dirty farm clothes in a pile in the mud room. Hats to mask their age and gender. Zélie yanked open the bonnet and then dropped under the truck. Clunks and cusses. Cori threw eight bales of hay in the back. Fifteen minutes later they sparked the ignition and stole it. It was good cover. Farm trucks are invisible. With luck, they thought, the owners might not find the truck missing for many hours.

They drove south following the River Saône after skirting Chalon-sur-saône. It took the rest of the night to drive down to Lyon. One hundred and fifty kilometers. Their target had become Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône. As they approached Lyon they pondered how to avoid watching eyes and the negative effects of multiple auto thefts.

The rebel and the runaway were three hundred kilometers from Port Saint-Louis. When they got closer they would decide what next. Cori thought a three-day passage to Alexandria. When Zélie asked how she would get the money Cori again pointed at the journal. This time she did in fact get punched in the arm. Zélie figured with three days on a ship she would get a straight answer or Cori have a swim.

Hours before, Sunday morning, Phaeton's voice had come across from Arc-et-Senans staticky and stressed. He was so tired he gave the story in short sentences with small words. Lovell had found it unbelievable. Philippe Messier dead? His office ransacked? The body's decay massively accelerating? Disturbing things!

The report of strange experiments was less concerning. Essentially all of Lovell's own experiments could fit under that heading. And he didn't know what to make of Phaeton's declaration that the whole strange business came down to some kind of campus cold war. What campus didn't have one or two of those? Still, Messier dead and the whole fabric of time.

Phaeton used crucial words. "Executed". "Cold war". "Secret experiments", "Exfiltrate". Had he used other words Lovell's reaction might have been less impactful. However, those words immediately steered Dr. B's mind to the kind of SAS flights that his radar had contributed to during the war. He thought of Lancaster paratroopers, infil gliders, and the Bruneval Raid. France, stress, and danger were subconsciously linked in his mind.

Those were the most dangerous days Lovell had seen. Though as a bit player, to be sure. He had done good technical work. The Army had been appreciative. Since those times, a certain Colonel had maintained occasional contact with Lovell. The officer wore the guise of a Commercial and Research Technical Equipment Liaison. A CARTEL man, if you like.

It was a low-key relationship not driven by Lovell. That said, a relationship that was becoming more and more important to him. The effort to fund Jodrell Bank's gargantuan Mark I telescope was hotting up. Military interest was to be courted. Cranial sparks combined in a predictable way. Lovell rang off Phaeton saying he would call back directly with the best news he could manage.

"Colonel Noshunse speaking

Lovell had never actually reached out to Noshunse before. Contact had been sporadic and always the other way.

"Colonel, this is Bernard Lovell. I think I may have something for you.

Bernard Lovell's voice didn't have far to go to reach Noshunse. The Colonel only left his country estate when duty called. Sadly, duty did call, though. It called much too often. Trips to pay bureaucratic homage to London couldn't be avoided. The national labs circuit and periodic visits to the research universities across Great Britain were also necessities. The same, though less often, to the institutes of New England. It was actually a lucky break he was working that Sunday morning in the upstairs kitchen.

The call interrupted Noshunse's own strange experiments. The research was such as would be categorized decades later as microfluidics, once that specialty was elaborated. Noshunse investigated the subduction of raw heather honey's surface tension using the capillarity affinity of warm butter-salt solvent wicked through a toasted white bread substrate. It was delicate work requiring concentration. However, as it was the academic network number ringing in the hall, he set the beaker down. Pulled off his gloves. Exited the sanitized workspace. Picked up the phone.

Five minutes later Noshunse unceremoniously dropped his lab coat and safety glasses and hurried to his third-floor offices. There he quickly went through his secretary's file cabinets. He made several calls rapidly. The first to his driver's apartment above the mews. Noshunse would require a car in not more than twenty minutes. The next call was to Gabrielle Renaudot Flammarion, |Madame la Directrice| of the private observatory in Juvisy-sur-Orge bearing her family name.

Gabrielle Flammarion was not summoned to take Russ Noshunse's call. Her young |bonne à tout faire|, Odette Connes, brought the heavy metal and wood instrument to her mistress in the conservatory. Gabrielle eyed the phone skeptically. She was comfortably in her seventies. Sharp as a tack. In fact, tacks gave her a wide berth. She grasped the handset in a way that tattled on her unfamiliarity with that item of modernity.

"Oui?

Noshunse had limbered up his French. Then he realized it would just be embarrassing and lose precious seconds.

"Madame, so good to hear your voice.

Noshunse got right to the point.

"The day we have so often mused on may well have arrived. Albeit, the individual, or perhaps individuals, were not foreseen.

When Gabrielle put down the phone she paused. Then she called Odette.

"Get Ferdinand.

Ferdinand Quénisset was notionally the |l'Assistant Astronome|. In reality, he was an old man, not younger than Gabrielle herself. After her husband, Camille, had died Ferdinand had become Gabrielle's constant companion. If anyone knew the metaphysics in question, it would be he.

"Bade him hurry. We are to have guests from the present who have little time.

Noshunse's work continued. Binders and folders. Diagrams. Loose papers appeared. More calls followed. They hastily arranged for observation, transportation, and support. One of them, on a hunch, resulted in a heavily accented voice on the line.

"Hey-low you. So long, Major!

Noshunse winced. Then spoke more rapidly than the flimsy command of the Queen's English displayed by the voice's opening line would seem to recommend. If you are thinking that voice was Har and wondering how in 1951 somewhere in Egypt Har had a telephone, you are astute.

Twenty minutes later the saloon pulled out the gate of Noshunse's estate onto a country lane that soon led to the trunk road north. Noshunse mainly used his driver, Casper "Cas" Corter, when he was taking a one-way trip or would be occupied with work or for some reason felt the need to keep a leg-breaker near to hand.

That day the back seat was crowded with binders, briefcases, and a large cardboard box. The materials he remembered were no longer crisp in mind. Cas broke posted speeds. During the hour drive to Holmes Chapel, the Colonel flipped through reports selectively. He read as deeply and quickly as possible, given the roads.

By late morning the black car pulled into a heavily vegetated drive. It rambled more than an eighth of a mile. Towards the end, the trees became regular orchard ranks. Neat fencing sprang up behind low dry stack walls. There were fields behind the trees. Hay and grain. They were well tended.

The car arrived at a dark charcoal gate with iron buckles. It opened an eight-foot brick courtyard wall. The sides stood ajar. Noshunse's driver jumped out and opened it further. He wasn't uniformed. He looked as out of place as a large ununiformed attendant could. They pulled into the forecourt and turned half around to bring Noshunse's side of the car to bear.

He unfolded himself to exit the auto. Tan brief, country hat, robust chukkas. He straightened a back that needed more thought than it had in the past. Paused to find a suitable greeting. Stepped smartly to the stoop and mounted it. Rapped on the stained oak door with stiff knuckles. Steps approached and it opened.

"Yes?

As ever before her, Noshunse fought the urge to present. He paused for recognition. It had been some time since they had last met. Some things weren't for the phone, even had one been available.

"Madame. It has been some years.

Having spoken, Noshunse made no motion on the steps.

"Colonel.

Noshunse took a risk.

"I bear news that may be of importance.

He paused. Her expression was unchanged.

"To Ktt Hathor Mutneferet.

Half took a beat, her eyes narrowed. Noshunse's shoulders tensed.

"If I may?

Then she took a half step back. She held the door open.

"Won't you please come in.

As he did, Half, the woman known as Ester, put her other hand to her chest in an unremarkable, gentle gesture. Akin to a formal half bow. Noshunse noticed she had tattooed fine wedjat eyes on the backs of her hands in henna. He followed her into a cool room. Wallstone, white plaster, oak beams.

Half wore a high-necked cotton blouse with black embroidery. Not Egyptian. Not French. Also not especially British. Hidden beneath that, a necklace of tiny nazar beads. Among those, a small and wonderfully worked falcon's eye of Horus. Had Noshunse been able to inspect the eye he might have sworn it was alive.

"I think already I know why you are here.

"
For another definition of |here| there was less certainty. The afternoon lay thick on a second-floor balcony over |Al Sopki| Alley in the |Al-Darb al-Ahmar| neighborhood of Cairo. Below were three narrow open-face shops. |La coiffe de crocodile|. |Le café aux crocodiles|. And |L'oeil du crocodile|. The latter being an optician sporting a rusted tin sign with an Uncle Pennybags crocodile in spectacles. As you might imagine, the same proprietor laundered money through all three. He dozed fitfully on the balcony.

A sudden involuntary swing of his arm sent a metal cup clattering on the cracked tiles. Ani Sadiki woke to his regrets, yearning, and still smoldering ambitions. Calls to prayers. Animals in the street. Children giving voice. The gossip of old men. A slow breeze carried savory lamb tangled up in every unsavory aspect of a Cairo alley.

He focused. His mind was alert, though his body had slowed. He paused. Why had he woken so? His eyes darted, looking for the |l'objet d'art| that was never far from hand. Onyx and bloodstone. Silver and weeping shale. Glass with powdered amber. Gold. His sole eye of Horus-Sobek. The first. Extracted from the smoking remains of a British armored car. It was there by his side. But something was new.

Sadiki felt a cold shiver in the heat. As he watched, the eye of Sobek inexplicably closed. It slowly reopened. It stared into him. The eye that bores deep. Sadiki found himself shaking in a hot north wind that shook only him.

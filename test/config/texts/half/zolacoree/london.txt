1951 - Cori and Phaeton collide in London, England

Cori Ashlar's train from Manchester arrived at Euston Station approximately when expected. A testament to generations of linemen, controllers, conductors, and locomotive drivers that over a century figured out how to make the trains run on time. They also ran on coal. Cori was happy to rapidly exit the shed. She pushed through the arch to what passed in London for fresh air.

Her goal was to get from Euston to Victoria Station for the next leg of the more than two day journey to Besançon. However, having more than seven hours to consume, Cori had concocted a plan. She would detour through Clerkenwell and Farringdon to the Guildhall at the north side of the City Of London. There she would have a few hours to revel in the atmosphere, artifacts, and ancient books of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers.

The Worshipful Company was one of many guilds with patents royal. By right it monopolized the clock and watch making trade in London and environs. The Company was born at the dawn of English watchmaking in the mid 1600s. Had her father, Edward, been a watchmaker in those times, in that place, he would have had to achieve liveryman status in the Company. Manchester had no such guilds, so the Ashlar family watchmakers faced no such stricture.

Having little to carry, Cori decided to save money by walking. The weather was unaccountably good. The distance was about two and half miles. She did it in about an hour and a half, while soaking up London. It was her first visit. The City was large, loud, and a bit overwhelming.

She took twisty streets through centuries-old neighborhoods. Struggled to imagine their tens of thousands of artisans. Individuals teethed, struggled with their tools, taught their children, and died unknown in those narrow streets. They had not had to tangle with taxis. Wandering into the remains of Clerkenwell Green, she reoriented south and made quick progress.

Cori arrived at Guildhall hot and disheveled. The first grand entrance was that of the Corporation Of the City Of London. It was under refurbishment by masons in overalls. They pointed her to hand printed signs leading around Basinghall Street. Basinghall narrowed and the walls grew baroque.

She almost passed it. A small side entrance with a brass medallion. It celebrated the Worshipful Company Of Clockmakers. Over the door the Company's motto: |Tempus Rerum Imperator|. She straightened. This was her door to her world. The world of Time, the ruler of all things. She entered, mouth ajar, and was lost to the mechanical past for four lovely hours.

"
Sometime during those hours Phaeton Athair woke up. He tumbled off the train. One minute Manchester Piccadilly, the next, London. The physics of trains was magic. He loved them.

His reaction to Euston was more nuanced than Cori's. The long dim shed with its small high lamps distracted his eyes up. Billowing soot. Heavy air. White noise rushing. His mind was content to drift. He was coming off months of focused effort to absorb the entirety of celestial mechanics. Billions of stars. Nebulas and molecular clouds. The planets and their moons. Floating in a sea of expectations-free stimulus was a day at the beach or cricket at Old Trafford.

He meandered with a half-smile till he found daylight. Outside, taxis. He had three and a bit hours to get to Victoria Station for a connection to the ferry. Like Cori, he was making the journey up as he went along. He had a couple days to spare for indirect routes, impromptu stops, and missed connections. He planned to spend most of that leeway in France. He had never been.

Another place Phaeton had never been was Westminster Abby. It was on his path. His mother, sharing his love of skywatching, had taken him to the Greenwich Observatory when he was ten, while his father did business elsewhere in London. She had wanted to visit the Abby to see Newton's burial place. They hadn't had time.

Phaeton stopped the cab at Westminster near the Commons. The Abby was, of course, stupendous. It soared upward in a way that pulled him out of his body, into the air currents, sweeping him to the apex. The grave of Newton was echoy and, though less visually impressive, had a gravity that any astronomer could feel in their bones. |Divinity, Chronology, Opticks|!

Phaeton subvocalized Alexander Pope's proposed epigraph, sadly unused.

"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night: God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.

After drinking in the mystique, Phaeton walked down the long nave. His eyes zoomed in on details. One pulled him: the modest monument to Jeremiah Horrocks, the so-called Keats of English Astronomy. Like Phaeton, Horrocks was of the west midlands. An autodidact observer, Horrocks predicted phenomena ascertaining the distance to the Sun and the acircularity of the motions of the moon.

"Ad Majora Avocatus Quæ Ob Hæc Parerga Negligi Non Decuit

Young Horrocks was also a part time churchman. He wrote the words of his inscription. They said his ecclesiastical duties took precedence over his changing the future of astronomy. Phaeton, one largely self-educated scientist to another, respectfully disagreed. He pantomimed a doff of his cap and exited by the west door.

Outside, Phaeton hailed a cab to Victoria Station. He still had time. His ticket was in his wallet. He practiced his French in his head.

"Dépêchez-vous monsieur, je dois prendre un train pour le continent!

In the tangle of Victoria, Vauxhall, and Wilton the traffic got viscous. The drivers, aggravated. Words were exchanged. Horns exercised. Gestures thrown. It was all very amusing. Abruptly his head hit the rear-facing seat in front of him.

The cab slewed a tire-dragging eighth turn counter clockwise. Glass breaking. The quick groan of stressed sheet metal. The cab's right front quarter dipped on its springs and rebounded. Breaks and horns complained. Traffic came to an abrupt pause. The heat death of the universe clocked an infinitesimal, but locally impactful, notch closer.

Outside Phaeton's driver was scouting the damage and hollering a guttural blast of vitriol at the offending driver. He moved like a boxer and bashed the roof of his cab in a way that got attention.

"Bloody scut-wit idiot! Why don't you watch where you're going?!

The other driver leaned out his window. Exiting his cab seemed risky, under the circumstances.

"You turned without even looking. How come you didn't see me? Open your gaadamn eyes!

The young passenger in the other taxi was holding the forward seat and staring like she had never seen an accident. Phaeton couldn't make her out well behind the glass in the dwindling daylight. She had dark curly hair. He looked at his watch. Time wasn't stopping.

His driver, shaking a fist full of the other cabbie's identification, swung in heavily enough to rock the springs again. They started forward. Phaeton looked back again. The girl was a dark silhouette. The driver was animated. Victoria was close. Phaeton was still on schedule. He was closer than he realized.

The superficially damaged taxi behind Phaeton's shook as it started. It coughed and died as if given too much gas. The cabbie started it again and let it run for a moment, despite the horns and shouts. Cori felt time slipping away. She fretted. Finally she banged on the seat. It was an effort to get the driver's attention. She demanded to get out right there. The tip was small.

Cori was on an unendorsed, unsupported run-away mission entirely of her own making. She was determined to get to Besançon to get straight answers to simple family questions. Traffic accident or no, she would keep moving. She felt she could travel faster under her own power. So that's what she did.

>1951 - Sisi wakes in Cairo

Let's go back a few steps to ask a really basic question: how did little Sisi take down a messianic cult of militaristic crocodilian high priests toting big guns and explosives? Sadiki, Haani, and all the Inspectors of the Kingdom's Secret Service Bureau would have loved to know.

Early on, Sisi wondered that herself. Then it dawned on her. Yes, she was awesome. But, no, even as a solo operator, she didn't operate alone. The eye of Horus flew above her. Her hawk-eyed goddess came in the form of an unruly, unpredictable post-adolescent sorceress with an attitude fit to model her own. Half was never far.

The first thing had been escaping. As Half had found not long before her, that was easy. Just walk away. True, into the desert. A desert that had a habit of eating the unwary as a light snack between covering ancient empires in sand. Nevertheless, with cleverness and desperation and a healthy dose of magical thinking, even the Western Desert abounds with life-giving stuff for a runaway naif to nosh on. At least for a time.

After that, she gradually made her way to the exploding modernity that was Cairo. She began seeking. She sought Half. She sought her parents. She sought a future. None were easy to find. So one day she sat down right in the chaotic center of Soliman Pasha Street. Closed her eyes, scrunched her defiant features, and pondered her life purpose.

"First, let me see a vehicle hit me. I think not!

The traffic zoomed and rumbled around her. It was both lonely and freeing. She thought more.

"Second, I will destroy them. I will close their so-called Eye of the Prow Rope. For good! Eye by eye. Damn them!

And so she had walked through the walls of secrets and influence. She had dreamed through the skies. She had knifed |fell√°heen| casing the homes of the powerful. She had thrown captains of chaos irregulars off Nile bridges. She had caused commandeered armored vehicles to spin off roads and tumble down ravines. Scaffolding fell. Walls collapsed. Fires burned. Sisi learned to laugh again.

One by one, she pocketed the shining eyes of Sobek-Horus. In her small Cairo apartment, a wall of visions of death. Each pinned and mounted. They were, in her hands, rendered as harmless as the strange physics of unimaginable potential energy can ever be. And with each eye obtained she grew stronger.

Yet in all this she could not get closure. One malevolent eye stubbornly roamed the earth. Close and yet out of reach. All the more impotent over time. And yet the potential for rebirth remained. For years she stalked it. And for years, time after time, it escaped. If just barely.

After a time her sense of the wayward eye diminished. Sisi found it less frequently. She fought it less successfully, as time and again it slipped away and became quiescent. And yet the Eye of the Prow Rope was indeed smashed. Its lone survivor, if not gone, at least gone to ground.

That is, until one morning. Without warning something woke all the Sobek eyes. Sisi sensed it. Strange physics approached Egypt from the north. An Egypt already beset: national oppression, religious fervor, economic collapse. A foreboding medicane barreled south to smash into the already blazing |simoom|.

Sisi sensed a rare opportunity. The final execution. There were concerning unknowns, for sure. Nevertheless, it was not a chance to squander. She intended to strike hard and, this time, not miss.

Sisi woke Har. They touched easily. They padded about their small apartment comfortably. They drank bitter coffee. Har laughed simply, just as he had when she had engineered their first meeting. Sisi smiled.

Chaos loomed over Alexandria. Chaos had become an old friend. They would drive north to welcome it.

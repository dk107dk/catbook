>1951 - Hrique traverses the Herodotus abyssal plain

The evening before they made Alexandria the ringing in Hrique's ears was bad. It drilled through the wind into his spine. He stared grimly at the edge of his world. The edge of the world was defined by a steel deck rail. It dipped and rose. On his side, wood, white paint, bleached canvas, and rust. On the other, the abyss. Two-meter heavy rollers slapped at an embarrassingly out-of-place splinter of mankind. The sea was wide. On the sunniest day it was unkind. The absence of kindness. A roiled expanse of nothing.

The wind aggravated Hrique's tinnitus. It aspirated in gusts. He had not accepted the permanent whine. He grabbed at the sound. He wrestled it. If he held his neck muscles just so. If he perfected breath control. Could he slow the ringing sound waves? Could he lower the frequency or slow down time? Where were his heartbeats? The wind and the waves? Time hidden by the infolding complexity of the world bloomed outwards. In the quiet of his determination, Hrique's world all but paused.

Then |Le Falaise| heeled over and bodyslammed a dynamical oceanic structure with the force of a skyscraper falling. Hrique lost his crouch by the cabin door. His left ankle doubled over. As his body tipped his right arm swung up into the deck rail. Knuckles ripped on rust blisters. He caught himself on his back foot. His body rose sharply as his shoulder slammed into the bulkhead. He caught a grip on the rail and steadied himself. He stared down the unruly ocean.

There was an eternity dissolved in the water. It carried him towards a land older than time. There he would confront children toying with the future of humanity. That night he looked to the stars for a sign.

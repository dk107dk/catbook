Eight blocks west, on the coastal highway originally paid for by Royal Dutch Shell, Har was at that moment fighting the unruly flow. The usual reckless, commercial vehicles crushed through more than the usual camels, carts, and horses. A crowd was jogging with them toward the point. Aboukir was covered in black smoke. Perversely, everyone wanted in. Har honked. Zélie and Cori beat on the doors and roof. Dents were levied. Progress was slow.

Zélie and Har argued incomprehensibly. They would move faster if she drove. Har disagreed. Tractors coughed blue exhaust. The car jerked and swerved. It bucked like a bronco at sub-bronco speed. Zélie's French got coarse. Har yelled energetically at Piaggio |Apés| and pushcarts. A camel spat at Zélie's window.

Cori couldn't get a word in. Finally, she became impatient. As usual, when Cori struggled with her geography she launched scouts. The canvas top was unclipped. Bay breezes and the river of traffic was an energy-rich environment. Some of her scouts circled up on thermals, some buzzed forward in dashes, some fluttered economically in the haze.

Soon enough she got the information she needed. She leaned over the seat. Cuffed Zélie to get attention and calmly told Har exactly how to drive. Har was not a native Alexandrine. And, anyway, he had been preconditioned by Noshunse to be edgy around the quiet Cori. He did as he was told without argument.

They flew up back lanes barely passable. Endangered fowl and goats. Bashed gates below villa windows. Squealed through unlocked construction sites. Even running down a dry canal used as a locals-only detour. They made the last mile in under eight minutes. Zélie sulked.

"
Well behind Har's car, the French |Défenseurs| contingent was heating up and annoyed. The car's black paint boiled. However, they were wired. The driver had radioed to send Gendarmerie or a local police escort. They expected to be moving soon enough. Fingers drummed. A large airplane circled low above its prey with its talons flared.

Renée had donned stylish oversized sunglasses. Hrique had given a clipped report on the brief voyage. Vartan had offered what little research had turned up. Communications lagged. Aubert squeezed his stocky frame up against the passenger-side rear window. He blankly stared, head fixed to the right. Stiffly avoided conversation and minimized movement. Unidentified metallic noises came from the direction of Yves. There were rumbles, honks, and deep vibrations. Soon his neck and head ached. Everything was new. It wasn't how he would have chosen to visit Egypt.

A large part of Aubert's troubles, and those of the occupants of Har's car, were due to Sadiki's trucks and the crowds drawn to the unsubtle occupation of Aboukir by foreign soldiers. It was an operation that had been tacitly accepted. Those on high who accepted, did so on the understanding that the occupation would transform smartly from a stealthy |fait accompli| to a generous |quid pro quo|. And under some flag other than the Union Jack or |Tricolore|. The unwritten deal by that point seemed unworthy of the paper it wasn't printed on. Things had gone badly wrong and a traffic jam was the least of it. Sadiki was itching to begin unwinding the deal back to the |status quo ante|.

He took one truck, Haani the other. They swapped riders. Freedom fighters with concealed guns and dynamite left the flatbeds. Rabble rousers with pitch-infused Molotov cocktails, scythes, and vintage Italian grenades jumped up. The insurgents filtered into the crowd and worked their way to the front. The trucks ever so gradually crept up to lead the crowd. They stopped right in front. The barbed wire barrier crossed the road between burned-out cars. Soldiers waved them back. Guns were pointed. Angry yells. No one spoke English. There clearly wasn't space to turn. The world seemed to slow with care as the volume rose. One wrong move would do it.

"
As it edged into the heaving square, acres of negative energy slowed the Topolino from twenty miles per hour down to almost nothing.

"What's that booming?

Har looked at Zélie. It was an argumentative look. Then he remembered Cori. Cori was climbing up to perch precariously on the roof.

"There are soldiers. Fires. Can you get us closer?

The car started forward again.

"I must. Colonel says I must to get you there.

At that moment three things happened in quick succession. Cori had a great view of them. From the left, a red nautical flare went up. At almost the same time a green flare arced over from the shore on the right. And within ten seconds an artillery piece fired from the headlands where the ruined castle hunched. The shell's ballistic trajectory ripped through the sky for two miles. It exploded in the tidal zone, close in. Twenty seconds later, another.

"They're aiming at Ibrâhîm's flare!

Haani yelled at Sadiki from the other cab. Sadiki could barely hear him.

"Now, boys, now! It's time!

Sadiki didn't think they could wait more minutes. Ibrâhîm and Hussein would understand. The big gun changed things. Sadiki imagined that in another three minutes more things would change. He was right.

Change came in the menacing form of two big Sikorsky H-5s. They were Carrier Air Wing 7's Fleet Angels detachment. CVW-7 was based on USS Midway, then ninety miles south of Cyprus. Noshunse had worked his magic through channels. A machine had been in the air shortly after dawn.

Andrews had scrambled a second H-5 with much less sangfroid, but equal efficacy. As soon as they arrived he press-ganged both birds. Both sent to the forward line with infantry M60 machine guns roped into open doorways. The Captain had heard scuttlebutt of this improvisational gambit. He was secretly pleased to have an excuse to try. Jeeps full of soldiers, Seabees, and sappers rushed down Depot Lane. Some heeding the call. Others just to see the improvised helicopter gunships.

By this time the Topolino was stuttering and heaving halfway through the crowd. Zélie was bearhugging Cori's knees as she swayed on the roof. The French executive car had pulled into the square three hundred yards back of the Fiat. Two consulate officers led on Peugeot motorcycles. Red and white flashing lights and anemic sirens. Yves stood with his torso out of the car's skylight. He had a burning road flare in one hand, a pistol in the other. He threw the flare ahead of the police bikes. Localized panic ensued.

Possibly taking a page from Yves, the riff-raff on Sadiki's truck took that moment to light rags stuffed in cola bottles full of flammables. Several arced over the barbed wire. A shell exploded a distance away. The artillery blasts were swinging closer. By that time well inshore.

Small arms fire was all around now. It had before been mostly aimed at the sun and clouds. Sights were coming down fast as panic, provocation, and hostility skyrocketed. Haani gunned his engine. And in all the sensory overload, Haani suddenly lost patience, threw the clutch, and floored it. Old industrial flatbeds don't exactly leap forward. Nevertheless, his truck covered the ground to the barrier sharpish. Sadiki's truck came scant feet behind Haani's.

The trucks smashed into the wire tangle and heaped rubble. They weren't going fast enough to cut through. Instead, they pulled the tangle tighter and created a dangerous spider's web whipping at the speed of a fresh gale. The crowd surged forward. Luckily for the Americans the machine guns overhead and barbed wire snaking and snapping at eye level gave the frontline protestors pause.

Har and the French driver saw the surge and the consequent flow in the crowd. Both revved up and stopped playing nice. At the other end, Sadiki's infill troops reached the back of the defense in time to emplace explosives and be awed by the firebreathing Sikorskys.

The gunships were to that point most effective at awe. Less so in any other way. Until three pounds of dynamite exploded behind one of the birds. Its pilot lost control and the chopper went into a terminal spin. It hit crazy angles where lift and drag got tangled. The machine went down hard on the wrong side of the barricade shedding hundreds of large-caliber cartridges as it did. Ultimately, an after-action review would show that the crash killed at least nine attackers, including two decapitations.

Pandemonium physics pinned the needles. In reaction, the drivers, the machine gunner strapped to skids of the remaining helicopter, and Mule Three's Gunnery Sargent two miles north all made the same understandable choice: they escalated. Sharply. Hard acceleration and hot metal.

Meanwhile, more than forty heavily armed combatants drew on each other point blank. And twenty young agitators with their gasoline bombs and sharp edges made a choice, too. They chose to not get the hell out of a battle they were ill-prepared for. Several died quickly. Others self-inflicted serious burns. The rest caused havoc off to the sides of a melee that had grown vicious and indiscriminate. Shells, dynamite, small arms, and a shaky five-hundred-rounds-per-minute hot rain from overhead.

In a few scant minutes, it had turned into the day Sadiki had waited forty years for. And then, from behind the battle, a much lower, louder boom punched chests so hard it cut through the chaos. As the boom reached a climax the sound waves unexpectedly, precipitously, inexplicably plunged into the infrasound and hung there. The world simply stopped.

Silence.

"
After a beat, Cori moved. Nonchalantly but with urgency. Cori wriggled free of her sister's frozen arms, kissed her head gently, and clambered off the Fiat. She hopped off a bumper that in a certain relative frame of reference was making nine miles per hour through the mayhem of a riot gone bad. At once amused, horrified, and anxious to get to the other side of the paused melee as quickly as... |pouvons-nous dire|? Possible?

She ducked under sharpened hoes. She slipped past falling bodies. There were bullets in flight. She avoided them. And too, the pressure waves of deflagrations. She didn't look at the fallen heads. She didn't untangle a body tangled up in tearing barbed wire. An otherwise average-seeming man engaged in bashing with the butt of a rifle wasn't her problem. She was pulled on a mission. One that dwarfed it all.

And yet it was so very personal.

Once past the barrier, it was easier going. She ran. Burning grasses glowed behind frozen heat shimmer. She emerged from dull gray smoke to plunge into darker ashfall. The road tar had become an instantaneously crystallized fluid. It didn't crunch under her feat. Pumice and particulate hung. And presently, breathlessly she arrived.

The caldera glowed. Waves of luminous material halted even as they swept out from the walls in huge periodic rings. The vast center of the impact crater floor caught drumming with pressure and elastic rebound. The artistic rendition of heat poured up in billowing marble from static transonic blasts. Cori clambered, slid, and tumbled down walls that had been caught rushing outwards in accelerating waves towards a world unprepared. Hades had no fury to compare. It was a majestic doom.

Finally reaching the floor, such as it was, the going became less terrifying, though more strenuous. The waves were each a scramble over vertiginous curls, sharp-edged tendrils, splashes, and threads. She did pull-ups till her arms ached. Her knees grew sore. Her hands, raw. What turned out to be the last wave was the tallest.

From the top, she looked around. The air was thick and unaccountably dim. The floor glowed dully with material blasted up from below. Mists and blobs of diamond in the sky. Spinning galaxies, swarming stars. Frozen as they whirled.

As she slid down into the gloom, Cori saw the sights she hoped she would see. She had reentered the dim land with its coruscant chaotic sky.

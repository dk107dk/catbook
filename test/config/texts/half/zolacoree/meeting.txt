>1951 - Cori, Zélie, and Phaeton meet in Besançon

Phaeton ended his seven hundred mile journey from Manchester to Besançon on time. The |Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Francais| line he had arrived on was the same branch as carried Philippe Messier's fiance Aurélie Conseiller away seven years earlier. He had no idea this fact would be associated with the SNCF in Messier's mind.

Stepping off the train at |Gare de Besançon-Viotte| he saw the nineteenth century dark green Jean-Paul Garnier station clock about twenty-five feet down the platform. The clock had been salvaged from the elegant former station, destroyed in the war. Phaeton checked his watch. It matched the station clock as near as he could see.

Phaeton didn't expect other people to be more timely then he typically was. The letter in his pocket from Messier said he would meet Phaeton at seven-thirty a.m. at the entrance of the station. There was a large waiting hall. Phaeton bought his first coffee of the day and opened a book.

Philippe Messier rushed into the station certain he was late. He had been up late pondering and planning. In his flat, not the Observatory. His flat was much closer to the station. Messier wasn't sure if Phaeton would be just the fresh perspective he needed or a babysitting job for an old friend. He realized he had no idea what Phaeton looked like.

Phaeton had had an easier time of it. Any Frenchman rushing in at approximately the half-hour, stopping in space, and scanning the handful of people occupying the entrance hall was the man he was waiting for. Phaeton was both logical and intuitive. Without a lot of thought, he just recognized Messier. Messier had arrived by bicycle. Phaeton carried a suitcase. They left in search of breakfast and solutions solving for that mismatch.

By coincidence, Cori's train arrived just as Phaeton and Messier left. She got off not knowing where she would stay or who should she see. It was exciting. The plan for her first solo expedition into the world was simple: Find her birth father, uncover who her mother really was, and generally reset her reality. Easy to say, but a tall order! Like Phaeton, she started with a cup of the worst coffee in Besançon, a small suitcase, and no bike.

Cori hoped somewhere in Besançon was family. She hoped she would find them before her few francs ran out. Happily, she did. From her perspective, it took an eternity and didn't go quite as she had imagined. It took what felt like another eternity for her to realize how well her plan had really worked.

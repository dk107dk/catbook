>1951 - Everyone at Aboukir

Beyond the makeshift barrier there came a deep thud. Sadiki's joints cracked. Haani steadied himself and looked away. The younger men exchanged nervous glances.

"That noise. What is it?

Sadiki was reassuring.

"The foreigners have much to worry about. They are attacked from all sides. Go to Ibrâhîm. He has the weapons you need.

Fifteen hundred yards north, in a tent in front of |Tabia Koussa Pasha|'s forward blockhouse, Captain Jansen Andrews, seconded to Strategic Air Command from the tenth Tactical Reconnaissance Wing held a mic close to his mouth. He was trained for intercontinental nuclear confrontation, not this. It was clearly a day for either medals or courts martial.

"We are taking causalities in a local disturbance. We sustained massive damage from an ordinance incident overnight. The camp is under attack from parties unknown with high explosives.

The ground-shaking booms were coming more frequently. He didn't know what they were. Dust spit out of cracks in dry walls. Small arms and the occasional smaller explosions he understood. Shouting. His radioman was missing. He needed close air or littoral fire. At hand to throw into the fray, at that moment, only amphib transports and a couple of lightly-armed fighters playing taxi. The radio signal was distorted. He strapped on a holster and ran for the jeeps. A Brit got in his way.

"You, with me. Get me to the barrier.

More jeeps were speeding about. Soldiers were mustering. By the time they got to the barricade, twenty rifles were facing what looked like two thousand Egyptians. Pushing and shouting. Sadiki and Haani's trucks slowly grinding to the fore. A C-121 acting as a spotter carved low circuits over the peninsula. Fires were still burning in a wide radius from the lost ammunition dumps. Andrews yanked the field radio and fired off commands.

"Mule Three, Mule Three. Prepare diversionary fire. Left beach, South, offshore, rapid fire. Two minutes and on my mark.

He snapped his chronograph and ran for the barbed wire.

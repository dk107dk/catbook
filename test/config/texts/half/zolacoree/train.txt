1951 - Cori approaches Besançon

Cori took local trains from point to point in the general direction of Besançon. She was in a hurry, not a rush. Hurry simply meant not dawdling. Seeing a bit of her homeland was fair game. Boulogne-sur-Mer to Lille. Lille to Amines. Amines to Reims. Reims to Nancy. Nancy to Dijon. Dijon to Besançon. Or anyway, something close to that.

She stopped to eat. She stopped to sleep. Between, she watched France in all its Frenchness at eighty kilometers per hour.

A train is the opposite of an art gallery, she thought. It is a collection of static faces looking at pictures that are constantly changing. In an art gallery, the changing faces judge the static artwork; whereas, on a train the static faces judge the smoothly changing canvas for its relative truth and beauty. Or, frequently, the absence of such.

Cori judged France, she thought, fairly. It was large and lush, largely pedestrian yet picturesque. Like England, only more so. It felt almost as much like home, and yet different.

After many hours of watching out passenger carriage windows, in a certain moment, Cori realized she was wrong.

To one so motivated, and with the unusual abilities required, a train is exactly like a gallery. Cori amused herself by turning the rushing countryside into a stop motion studio. A freeze frame examination of a life similar to hers, but not quite alike. Pausing the urgent blur of the locomotive. Capturing the instantaneous image in a colored cell on the bright light table of her eye. The France of an instant in time. There for singular inspection.

Flowers in their arc of day. The songbird's vice of lift and fall. Cirrus ribbons wrapped the sky. As fields were caught swaying. Insects caught swarming. Cars caught by crossing guards stared back at Cori, eyes opened wide.

Then she let the reel go. And in the next instant, she froze the next cell. Her world animated forward. Tick by tick. Frame by frame. Besançon crept closer.

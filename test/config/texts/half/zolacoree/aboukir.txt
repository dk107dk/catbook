>1951 - Cori and Zélie reach Alexandria

The morning Cori and Zélie arrived in Alexandria, the worst of the Aboukir fires were contained by dawn. Aboukir was not obliterated. The camp commander, Rusty Andrews, took that as a good sign. It weighed at least something against the many bad ones.

At least two marines were dead. They lay under sheets at the side of a hut. Remarkably their deaths were not directly due to the flaming air disaster visited on Aboukir. Rather some locals had assumed the suspicious foreigners had been under attack by partisans. They had wanted in on it.

Four disheveled and sleepy marines had been on watch at the end of the road leading to the abandoned field. A few mean adobe houses clustered a couple of hundred meters toward town. When the ground shook and the sky filled with smoke, men in loose shirts without headwear tumbled out of the houses looking for the fourth battle of Aboukir. Fully in support of whatever attack was in progress, they began firing rusty |Glisentis| in the smoky air. This prompted counter-fire. Likewise prompting a brief escalation. Not long after, the locals dragged their dead away. The marines laid out their losses. A tense dawn broke.

The stone wall where the guard tent stood had broken pottery and glass. A tin with a bullet dent. Blood and sweet beer. A gang of seabees was attempting to turn the rubble into a defensible wall. Burned out cars, seawall rocks, propane tanks, cement blocks, iron bars, and anything else they could lay hand to. They broke windows and sprinkled the shards before their wall.

Lads of about ten or twelve sortied. One threw a rock. They scampered off. There were distant shouts. The air moved as heat poured north to the sea. Far out by the ruined fort at the end of the peninsula, a tug horn sounded. There were gulls. The guards ran barbed wire.

"
A few minutes drive east was Edku Town. The place of Ani Sadiki's birth. Off the beach, faded |flouka| crisscrossed Abi Qir Bay. They paused to watch the heavy smoke pouring off the headlands. Few watchers bore direct imprint of the last pitched battle on the point. None were completely free of the imprint of ammunition boots. They were more intrigued than alarmed.

At five-thirty a.m. Sadiki crouched under a tree on the reedy banks of |Al Miaddiyyah| channel. Everyone heard the concussions in the night. Sleep had not come. There was fire on the clouds before dawn. He told himself to have patience. What would come would in due course come all the way, not merely turn cartwheels on the horizon.

He obtained khat and black coffee. His coffee resisted the twig he stirred it with. Up the lane, the men were waking too slowly. He threw rocks at fish. The fish were angry. But they didn't swim away. And they didn't throw the rocks back. They were Egyptian fish, he thought sourly.

The gang had arrived at Sadiki's and Haani's ancestral compound the evening before. They came on two platform and canvas long-haul trucks. The men had bartered, called in favors, begged, and stole. Sadiki's narrow apartment building, the one with the crocodile-themed retail, had already been liquidated. Fat Ahmed El-Hallag, that pup-bat-biting slumlord channel rat, sucked Sadiki dry on the trade. So much so that Sadiki had ultimately gifted much of his personals to the Preservation Society of Lulua Mosque, since, as he loudly made it known, he was charitable to the less fortunate.

All stress aside, money had been raised for the expeditionary force with alacrity. The men were already restless. After days of manic activity, they exited the city heading north. It had been twilight. They drove fast. Bullets in rough boxes, guns in gunny sacks, and detonators strung on fish strings. They were well-armed.

Twenty-one hours later Ani Sadiki was in a state of contemplative angst. For the first time in almost forty years he stood on the banks of the water he had bathed in, played in, and looked deeply into. Had any been good years?

An old man quietly joined him. They looked at the water. Their reflections were distorted. Nevertheless, their features were similar. Saeed's reflection put his thin hand on Ani's shoulder. Tears flooded Ani's eyes. He threw one more rock before turning away.

"
Earlier that same morning that Sadiki made enemies of fish, Cori and Zélie debarked in Alexandria. As |Le Falaise| steamed towards the outer breakwater there had been a dramatic flash off to port over Anfouchi Bay and the ruins of Fort Adda. It had been around two a.m. A paparazzi of lesser flashes lit the clouds. Aboukir was twenty kilometers off. The sisters hadn't known what they were seeing.

A pilot came aboard at speed a kilometer out. They made Arsenal Quay. The ship took its time berthing. Tug at the bow. Merchant mariners and customs agents swarmed. Roustabouts with end-of-shift voices. Oil, coal, fish, and tarred timber. Whistles and bells. The ship kept its boilers fired.

The wharves were cobbled and tracked. A double row of cheap Fiats and Seats waited to become dusty taxies. Exhausted native arms hauled man-carts of bags, bales, and barrels.

Cori spotted paramilitaries at the dock gates. Police cars beyond. Flashlights waved from the shadows. With only a few ships newly docked, dock work was muted. Nevertheless, security was tight. Aboard, passengers were sparse on deck. Stewards knocked at seven-thirty a.m. Cori and Zélie were docksides before six. That their next move was vague didn't stay their impatience to make it.

The Egyptian air was smokey. It blended the port and city smells and tasted like an accelerant. The customs office took their papers without a word. Traffic beyond the gates was nonexistent. This seemed unlikely. Outside, papers blew through the streets. Police cars idled. The wind heated up and began cracking flags. Egyptian Arabic drifted about muttering under its breath. The sisters stayed close together.

Right about the time they were realizing they didn't know what next and didn't feel tremendously safe in their surroundings, a battered Fiat Topolino square-back squealed in a tight u-turn and screeched to a shabby halt in front of them. An Egyptian man yelled through the window.

"Hey. Zolacurée Ashlar et Zélie Barraqué, non?

The voice was urgent and seemed unsure about French and English.

"Yes?

Zélie was guarded. She stood between Cori and the car, protectively. The car's suicide door flung open.

"Get in. Now. Quick. Is wrong trimestre. Bad time.

They crouched and looked at him. Zélie considered his Franglais abominable. Amusement tussled with alarm. It was taking a kicking. Cori's eyes were wide. A policeman was becoming too interested.

"How I know you names? Colonel say, say Phaeton send me.

In a second they had tumbled in. Cori in the back. The policeman ran after, stick waving. Har pealed out and swerved into the inauspiciously empty street. Within ninety seconds he had taken three rights and two lefts. Zélie approved of his driving.

Within one hundred and twenty seconds it became apparent to the sisters that Alexandria was in a foul mood and that day there would be fighting. Fists and dark angry eyes. The two French gals looked at each other. They would not have fared well.

It was becoming abundantly clear that the sisters hadn't thought anything through nearly as well as they had thought they had. Which wasn't really saying much.

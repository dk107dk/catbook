Saturday morning was a good time to visit the Time Lab. Chronometer testing went on twenty-four-seven. However, there were fewer associates and researchers. Consequently, more opportunities for visitors with a knowledgeable guide to dig into equipment and methods. Cori had an excellent tour guide. Zélie was not quite a researcher. Yet, certainly more than an intern.

The Chronometry Building was about seventy feet long and thirty-five wide. It had below-ground floors and a loft. The subbasement was deep and structurally complex. The building's foundations rested on piles. Nestled within that tub-like slab was a low crawlspace with a steel frame supporting the floor plate. In the frame, passive friction dampers converted any vibration energy into heat by flexing heavy couplings. The three stories of useable space essentially floated on steel within a concrete teacup.

On the lower level were the lab, offices, and storage space. Above the lab were workshops, metrology research benches, and more small offices. Behind the building, a tools and metals fabrication shop, a few parking spaces, and a perfunctory orchard.

The lab itself took most of its floor. It housed walk-in refrigerators, stacks of ovens, vibration tables, reefs of gimbals, a large pressure vessel, and racks of chronometers nestled in testing cases. Four long benches occupied the center of the room. Around the edges, cupboards and counters. The ceiling was bare tin. Tarnished by then. Originally crafted to reflect gas lamps. Later, electric lights. The walls were glossy white.

Just as Cori was about to follow Zélie down, Phaeton walked in.

"Cori! I saw bicycles and guessed. Are you getting the tour?

Cori spun around and looked up from two steps down. Phaeton looked like a dark giant lit from behind.

"Yes. This is where Zélie works, down here. Have you been?

He had not. Philippe had never continued their walk through the observatory campus. The Chronometry Building had felt somehow off limits. He followed Cori down.

As it was early on a Saturday, an apprentice was manning the floor. Others would no doubt trickle in. The lad's name was Christin. He had been borrowed from a manufacturer of mainspring assemblies for the summer.

"Hi, Zélie! Thanks for coming to relieve me so I can go fishing. I left you all the hot work, just to be fair.

Zélie was amused.

"Why go fishing around for trouble when you can get into lots of trouble right here?

She screwed up her face in thought.

"On second thought, you're right. You stay and I'll take the day off. Oui? It's a good suggestion, fishing

Phaeton was interested in the refrigerator and ovens.

"How did they keep the temperature steady back fifty years ago?

Christin took him over to the ovens. They were gas. In fact, little changed since the eighteen-nineties. Zélie and Cori drifted over to the intake racks. They looked at the precise hand-winding ratchets.

"We get hundreds of chronometers in some days. They all have to be grouped and inspected. Lots of paperwork. Then they have to be wound very exactly and racked. Of course, we have to make the line progress so there is space for the new ones.

Cori was quietly horrified. This sounded not unlike what she remembered of formal schooling.

"Don't you get bored? Do you get to do anything fun?

Zélie was a bit deflated. She didn't think the lab was all that. However, she had hoped it was a little bit cool.

"The metrology work upstairs is the good part. I get paid for being a troll down here. When I'm a good troll for a while they let me up. Then I work on standards and measures for frequency regulation.

That sounded a bit better to Cori. She looked across the lab. Phaeton and Christin were fooling with chronographs just out of the ovens. That seemed worrying. So far she had been careful to stand back from the watches under test. Under the circumstances, though, she thought that strategy might need a rethink.

She cautiously picked one of the chronographs from a batch. It was cool, smooth, and worth much more than she had spent since leaving Holmes Chapel. She put it down and picked up another. And another. She touched as many as she could without drawing attention. Zélie didn't seem to care.

"Let's go see what the boys are up to.

Zélie led them around the benches to the ovens. Cori looked at Phaeton. She suspected he had no idea. She leaned up.

"Show me what you're looking at.

Phaeton was happy to. They were Cartier. Top-of-the-line pocket watch chronometers. They would certainly receive the viper. The tray held twenty-four. Half were silver, half gold. Cori picked one up. It was a self-winding chiming chronograph with a skeleton face to show off its tourbillon and complications. It was a beauty. It was also several orders of magnitude more coarse than Cori's iridescent aerial companions. Out of respect for the brotherhood of watchmakers, those stayed well hidden.

They turned to head upstairs. Before they got to the stairs, Aubert came down. He was surprised to see them. Oddly, it didn't seem a happy kind of surprise.

"Ah, you're all together then. Phaeton, the Director is looking for you.

Then to Zélie.

"I'm glad you brought them on the tour. But you really shouldn't interrupt the diligence. Christin has to keep on schedule.

Zélie made a face. This was a more familiar Aubert.

"No problem. Partir n'est pas un problème.

Cori pulled on her sleeve.

"Common. Let's go with Phaeton. We can see the upstairs later.

With a parting glare, Zélie was up the stairs.

"
The three of them took a less taken path: a diagonal straight from Chronometry to the Equatorial Coudé building. Headquarters of those who looked up, not down. Philippe had his office in the building. It was convenient to the residence for when his observations knocked his schedule off-balance. The elegant tholobate offered useful telescopes, tall windows, small offices, and great views.

They found Philippe Messier at his desk. His office looked over the fields. It felt much higher than it actually was. He had been worried. But looking up, he found that he was just glad to see them. He had not met Cori. Though he gathered she was staying with Zélie. He did not know Zélie well, either.

"You must be Cori?

Cori answered in French, as a citizen should.

"Je suis ravie de faire votre connaissance. Je m'appelle Zolacurée Ashlar.

Philippe was charmed.

"You have such a fabulous, and if I may say, flamboyant name, oui? Très évocateur! In any case, welcome.

A shadow passed over Philippe. Some thoughts darken clear air. It seemed silly, he thought, not to get right to it. He turned to Zélie. Paused. Then spoke.

"Mademoiselle Barraqué. You perhaps have un petit secret, non? Some history with the Observatory?

Philippe kept his voice flat. It was not done perfectly. Cori edged closer to Zélie.

"You mean beyond working here for two semesters?

Philippe had triggered Zélie's obstreperousness. Before that went any further, Cori spoke.

"His name wasn't really Jacques de Saulcy, was it?

As Cori asked the question her hand slipped into Zélie's. For protection or morale support, who can say? Philippe turned his full attention to Cori, reappraising.

"No, it was not.

The silence lasted quite a moment.

"You both are his children? Half-sisters? Perhaps?

They nodded.

"And you came to Besançon looking for him?

They nodded again.

"Well, and because the University offered me a place out of the clear blue sky. So that too.

A heavy moment. Nevertheless, Zélie didn't back down.

"Indeed. In fact, I had heard of you myself. I arranged it. We can speak of that another time. Had I known who you were. Well, I would have had to think.

Both Zélie and Cori spoke in stereo:

"Why?

And:

"What are you not telling us?

Philippe looked at the disassembled hardware on his desk. Small telescope parts. Hand-crafted metalwork tools. Practical stuff.

"What was our father's name?

Cori looked at him intently.

"The man you didn't know, was named Georges Juan Marat. That name is unfamiliar, yes?

The sisters nodded.

"You may see it here and there. He was my illustrious predecessor. The director before me. There is quite a story to all this. I assume you want to hear it?

More nodding.

"Very well. Take a seat. On something comfortable. I assume you want him to stay for the story?

He indicated Phaeton. They did, though there was barely enough space.

"Louis Jules Gruey. You know that name, oui? Our first director. The prime mover. The source of our incidence towards the Astros-Chronos beam splitter. The quarter-turn from Aristotle's unmoved mover. He who moves and is in consequence is moved.

He briefly paused as if pondering how much abstruse nonsense his young audience would take.

"Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis. Time changes and we are changed by it. This seems a small statement. Easy, no? Surely there is nothing outside of time. Time, the Ruler of All Things. Tempus Rerum Imperator.

Zélie accidentally kicked a box of academic journals.

Philippe paused for a beat.

"I'll stop with the Latin now, yes?

Zélie was strongly in favor. Cori seemed unconcerned. Phaeton was daydreaming a bit.

"The point is, people say a lot of things about time. They make assumptions. Here, at the Observatory, we just make measurements and, well, observe stuff. And yet, what we observe changes us. As it turns out.

Some part of Phaeton's day-dreamy brain found a reason to sit up and start paying attention.

"Back when Louis built the place, he was first and foremost an astronomer. However, time was then very much the issue of the stars. Time and space. Navigation. Today we have more abstract concerns. Then, it was all about the motions of heavenly bodies controlling the movements of clocks and ships moving across meridians.

Cori was very still. Knowing Cori as we do, she may have been doing many things in the eons she spent waiting for each next word to come. Zélie was thinking Philippe might get on with it. Philippe loved his words. Years later it would be called mansplaining. Given we're talking about a tenured professor, the Y-axis would be log-scale.

"During the decades-long effort to bootstrap the Observatory from a bright idea to a self-sustaining institution, Gruey changed. Some change was due to academic and funding politics. A big part of it, however, seems to have happened to him during two long trips he took to various centers of science and metrology.

The story was veering into boardroom territory again. Eyes glazed.

"Gruey kept a journal. As has every director since. Those journals have remained hidden. They document the tension between Chronos and Astros, among other things.

Zélie was going to ask to see the journals. Philippe hurried on.

"Gruey's entries change during his second international mission. His thinking becomes at once magical and conspiratorial. A toxic combination, à mon avis.

Phaeton looked at his watch. He didn't do that much.

"At the heart of it was Joseph Plateau. The inventor of the Phénakisticope. A blind old man, when Gruey met with him. Plateau got under his skin. Somehow he persuaded Gruey that there was a grain of time. A fundamental quantization.

Philippe was doing a pendulum thing with his fingers.

"Were that true, you could say that we live in an animation. Perhaps a spinning Phénakisticope. Or a cartoon.

Cori sat very still. Philippe kept busy not looking at her. She kept busy being unintentionally disquieting.

"You know the Phénakisticope, yes? A disk of figures with regular slits cut out. You look through the slits and see the figures animated. It demonstrates the persistence of vision. But what it suggested to Gruey was that the world might be one giant animation seen through the slits of time. So, bien, off he went to look for that.

Philippe had a Phénakisticope. It had a pattern of snakes. The Besançon viper, of course. It was printed in Belgium. He handed it to Cori.

"There are a few of these lurking in various dark corners.

Phaeton looked like he would like to have one too.

"So, if you are an astrometrician, where do you look for the grain of time? C'est facile! You look for jitter in the stars as they cross the meridian.

Philippe looked up at his hand edge-on as if it were a line drawn on the sky.

"But, maybe you don't see any jitter. What then? Well, if your mental model is the Phénakisticope, you may wonder if you might see a change in the background behind the fixed foreground reality.

Philippe was getting hand-wavy.

"Imagine, as each cell or section becomes the active frame, you see a foreground carefully crafted to be consistent. But the background may have marks, blemishes, and mistakes. Things usually unseen, but apparent if you change your focus. So this is what our director did.

Phaeton had a strange look on his face. Though, to be fair, at various points in all this, that could have been said of any of them.

"The deep field!

Philippe turned to him warily.

"Yes, indeed. I think you know a bit about what comes next.

Phaeton explained to the others.

"Looking into space we see a few thousand points of light. But looking at a galaxy we can see many more stars than that. Where are the rest?

Phaeton was looking at Cori as he spoke. She was engrossed.

"Deep field astrographics collects light our eyes cannot see. Invisible photons arrive over a prolonged time. The difference from regular observations is that you stare at nothing and wait for whatever is there to reveal itself. Faint light collects over hours, days, and even, in principle, years.

Zélie felt staring at nothing was a silly use of time. Cori was intrigued. Philippe looked increasingly worried.

"Indeed. Mais c'est là que les problèmes commencent. As we started with, people have a lot of thoughts about time. Few of them are testable, provable science.

Philippe gestured as if to assure them that everything in the observatory was in service of provable science.

"In some ways our modern relativity and quantum physics require more imagination than the unknowns of our forebears. Louis felt that his temporal reality had begun to slip. He had been fixated by the idea that we are in an animation. But his actual observations were so much stranger.

Zélie liked the living in an animation concept. You could see her pulling the film faster and slower in her mind. Mostly faster.

"Scientists tell stories to explain what they see. The story that Louis came to believe is that his search for the frame rate was successful in that he had sped up the animation. How? Who knows. His notes become, shall we say, imprecise.

Cori wondered if his gesture unintentionally indicated where the journals resided.

"The story that another observer decided on was that Louis had become a time demon. A being who had the power to age his surroundings through proximity and touch. A depraved manipulator. Kālá, the destroyer of worlds.

He paused for effect.

"That was his wife, Marie.

Philippe continued in a jaunty tone.

"So she shot him. In the residence. You can see bullet holes in the walls even now.

A wife who shoots guns made him smile, wryly. He thought of Aurélie.

"I could tell you it was Germans. You would certainly believe me. No, actually the holes are from a madwoman shooting at a demon. It is true! Truth is weird. Some loves aren't meant to last. Some loves are born to result in gunplay. C'est la vie, non?

Zélie was amused in spite of herself. Cori was amused because of Zélie. Phaeton felt like he had had their attention briefly on something truly important. Somehow he had lost out to insanity and guns. He was not amused.

"Anyway, the point is, before he got shot, Louis was causing trouble. His number two was a man named Auguste Hrique. That name is familiar, yes? To you at least?

He was looking at Zélie. She nodded. Hrique was the surname of her boss's boss.

"Well, Auguste was the nephew of a mathematician who had early on been picked to create the Observatory. Only, through hook and crook, the uncle was pushed out before the first stone was laid. Gruey was given the nod. He and Gruey soon made nice. And through his own hooks and crooks, Auguste made himself Chief of Chronometry.

Philippe paused a beat longer than he probably should have.

"It is pure happenstance that today a Hrique is again in that position.

Philippe had cocked an eyebrow in a way that threatened a sprain. He continued.

"Auguste saw it differently from Marie. He came to two more straightforward conclusions. One, the experience of extreme scale somehow forces an anisochrononomic entangling with time. And, two, there must never be another Louis Gruey!

Phaeton's eyes were large. That hit close to home. Meanwhile, Philippe had a small wheezing fit. Cori somehow materialized a glass of water. After a drink and an odd shiver, he continued.

"les Défenseurs du Temps Constant was Auguste's idea. A shadowy group of time-obsessed wingnuts. Wingnuts? Nuts, de toute façon fou. Complètement tarée!

Philippe came from the if-you-are-unsure-of-what-you-are-saying-repeat-it-as-many-ways-as-possible school of elocution.

"Or were they? Eh, is it possible they reacted irresponsibly while being spot-on conceptually? Who knows? It was all very cloak and dagger. Still is.

It was getting towards lunchtime. All were engrossed. Philippe continued.

"I wasn't there, of course. I was born the year Gruey was murdered. I joined the scene twenty years later as an associate Chronos. Auguste never rose to Director. He retired the year I arrived. I rapidly moved up because I'm, how to put it, compétent au-delà de toute mesure.

Zélie turned her head to allow her eyes privacy to roll.

"Soon I took the place of our fourth director: Georges Marat. Indeed, Marat abdicated. He came to me the evening he vanished. Fearing for his life. He thought les Défenseurs were coming for him. His plan was to take a new name, Jacques de Saulcy, and leave France forever. Last I saw him, he was disguised as a farmer hauling grain to the mill downriver. I never saw him again.

This was certainly not enough information for the sisters. Nevertheless, they did not interrupt.

"Oui, well anyway, much came before that. Marat was intrepid. He had found Gruey's notes and deciphered them. He broke into the crypts, wells, and tunnels. And like Gruey, he traveled to learn what other lands knew. Scandinavia, North Africa, the Alps. Somehow he discovered a secret society in the English Midlands. The Tempora Mutatori. When Lovell sent you to me from Manchester I wondered.

This last was to Phaeton.

"Gruey's description of the Tempora Mutatori hinted at many things. Most may be nonsense. When I became director and learned of it, some things stood out as testable propositions.

Cori was curious.

"What made our father run? How did you become director?

Philippe laughed, seeming to hear a joke to cover for a gaffe. He was French. She was young and only sort of French.

"How I became Director was political, naturellement. A long story. Let's say I made careful observations and then massaged my results to suit the reviewers.

This very academic explanation didn't really land. He pushed on. Cori noticed he answered only one of her questions.

"Here's the simple proposal. Spacetime has hard barriers at small and huge. Each side of those barriers has its own timescale. If you get too close you can become entangled. When you tangle yourself up in another timescale, you have an effect on the world around you.

Philippe didn't look like he expected that explanation to work.

"Think of a gear train. A large gear moves slowly. It spins a smaller gear faster. That in turn spins a still smaller gear faster still. Our world is the middle gear. The infinitesimal and the gargantuan turn with us. Each at its own speed.

Philippe summed up.

"The idea is that Astros or Chronos that explore these mysteries may wield a kind of "mechanical advantage" without understanding what they do. The results are unpredictable. Generally, unfortunate.

Philippe was looking at Phaeton gravely. Then the moment broke. He finished up offhandedly.

"Anyway, that's what they say. These Tempora Mutatori.

Phaeton was nodding now.

"It's the quantum entanglement, isn't it? Or something like that? A sympathetic resonance. Over days and years the lonely photons collect. Your soul stretches to become the photograph of an instant in the infinite timescale. That's right, isn't it?

Philippe nodded gravely at Phaeton's poetic description.

"Perhaps something like that. Who can say? Perhaps just looking for the sake of seeing beyond the barrier does it. If I peer at stars, bien sûr, I simply see stars. Ah, but if I peer into the abyss, well, they say that if you peer too long into the abyss, the abyss likewise peers into you.

Philippe paused. That phrase evoked Aurélie and pain. He took a breath and focused out the window.

"Mais oui, for sure the abyss has effects. For instance, the effect of being shot as a monster. And another thing. Apparently, it is hard to let go of once you begin. It seems to be addictive.

Cori was nodding now. Zélie thought she saw the same shadow come over three faces.

"One can reach the small barrier too, can't you?

Cori's voice was quiet. Philippe spun to her. And all but froze for a moment staring at her.

"Yes, of course. What goes up must equally come down, non? Or rather, what may go incredibly slowly must equally be able to run really, really fast. So say the Time Mutators. Mademoiselle, why do you ask?

It was a leading question, lightly asked. The undercurrents were electric. And in response, a tiny miracle flew out from behind Cori's curls. It turned and danced. A sunbeam off the river of photons flowing in from French fields.

"Ah, I may see now.

Philippe's eyes were wide.

"The Mutators believed in balance. Balance that keeps our present whole. In this room, I think maybe we have found our own balance.

At that convenient moment, the front door banged loudly. Philippe spoke |sotto voce|.

"Eh. Go now. Have a walk. Take care. We will talk more later.

And then more darkly.

"I would advise you to not speak of what we have discussed to anyone. S'il vous plaît!

He hurriedly shuffled them out of his office to the back stairs. It seemed there was actually nobody in the narrow building. In Cori's backpack, however, to say nothing of on all their shoulders, a new weight settled.

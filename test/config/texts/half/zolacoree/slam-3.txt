Said disturbance was widespread west of the city. The centroid was at the approach to Aboukir. Sadiki and Haani intended to inflame that convergence point with fervor. They imagined no second chances.

At Sadiki's ancestral home, they had prepared. Fifteen freedom fighters scurried about the trucks. Stripped to the metal. The diesels shook their chassis with a bone in their teeth. No one said a word.

Cousin Haani's beard was near white. His forehead pressed into Ani's. Rolling thumps from the coast knocked their skulls together. A culmination was coming. They gripped each other's shoulders. Their eyes sank deeper as the world receded. The pressure was immense. Each finally realized how truly dark the other's depths were. They had had no idea.

Earlier that morning everything had been cartoon-like in its intensity. Pull-focused, gauze-filtered, hand-colored, and running at twenty-four frames per second, blasting past the flicker fusion threshold. Bright animated birds swooped in impossibly tight loops. They sang martial songs in tones at once stirring and terrifying. Some of the candy-red boxes were labeled TNT. Some of the men's eyes popped in profile. Soviet Man, Wile E. Coyote, and the Cigars of the Pharaoh. The sun lit Maxfield Parrish clouds almost in mockery. Sadiki's life had been strange. The last reel was set to run down with a bang.

Shehata Atalla Sadiki was back-bent and tired. She knew. She handed her son a cotton-wrapped mid-day meal she feared he would never eat. Touched his face. Whispered. He kissed her forehead, turned, and mounted the cab of the first truck, riding shotgun. Dogs barked as they pulled out of the compound.

They rattled up the coast between the bay and the saline Lake Abu Qir attracting attention. The trucks regularly spit large caliber rounds in the air. Haani leaned on the horn. They clapped, chanted, and beat the cab and doors. A call to arms. The trucks stopped repeatedly to pick up angry youth with t-shirts tied around their heads. Taxis and three-wheelers slid in behind. The road was growing crowded with bicycles, carts, farm animals, Vespas, and the bare feet of fishermen, weavers, field hands, removals men, and colliers. A few students. A few torches. Improvised banners of bedsheets and boat tar.

Through it, Richter-scale whumps from Aboukir. Every few minutes. Were they growing louder? They cracked pavement and foundations. The smoke. There were shots fired ahead. A thin call to prayer echoed above it all. Nobody was answering it.

Suddenly the crowd was jogging in a surge. Motorbikes were forcing their way through. At a certain moment, they erupted into a square formed where the main road to Alexandria crossed the road to Aboukir point. Sadiki pointed. The men hung off the open sides of the trucks. The smoke was a wall. There were rocks in the air. More people were pouring in. Shots and explosions were an impenetrable static. There was insurrection. There was fear.

In the night, after the plane crash, the Anglos had dragged wreaks, rocks, and barrels across the northern running so-called Depot Lane, in better days, |Rue d'Aboukir|. Depot Lane was a wide paved but ragged road up the sandy spit from the cross at Al Tabaya Road. It led past the abandoned airbase to an equally abandoned massive star-form redoubt |Tabia Koussa Pasha| and on to the ruined tower bastion on the point, |Al Burj Abu Qir|. Two small groups of British or American soldiers were running strings of new barbed wire on steel and cement posts in front of the makeshift wall to replace nineteen-forties vintage.

Villagers gathered from huts and small adobe compounds along the shore caught between the point and impromptu barrier at the edge of the larger Abu Qir Town. They were sullen and fearful. The children threw rocks. Not at the soldiers. Close enough to bear watching. Most of the small boats left for less dangerous landings.

"Take five men and see if you can work your way up low tide behind their camp.

Sadiki give the east group a green rocket and the west a red one.

"If you think you can approach the barricade from the north send up the rocket. We will attack the front. You have twelve minutes.

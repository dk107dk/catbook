1951 - Noshunse and Rabaha over RAF Aboukir, Alexandria, Egypt

The Bristol Buckmaster was struggling. They had blown a tire in a rough landing at Corsica. The new one had been slow coming. Then, approaching Sicily, turned back with a fuel leak. Now, this. It was frustrating!

They were flying about thirty minutes west of Alexandria. Eleven thousand feet. A few littoral lights were visible in the distance. Turbulence was light. And yet the plane was shaking. The screws were coming loose. Literally.

Metal fatigue was a fast-creeping plaque. They watched it spreading. A sheet of aluminum skin behind the aileron ripped off the right wing. A stringer suddenly sprang across the fuselage as it tore away from two ribs. It nearly broke Cas Corter's arm. Rabaha Zayani in the copilot's chair pointed to a long strip of window flashing flagellating in the pressure wave. The airframe groans were getting louder. There was a constant rattle of pings, pops, and clangs cutting through the roar of the eighteen-cylinder engines. The bomber was coming apart around them.

"Mayday, Mayday. This is Timekeeper 1145. RAF Buckmaster trainer thirty miles off Alexandria.

Colonel Russ Noshunse looked at Rabaha as if something was on the tip of his tongue.

"Metal fatigue. Our airframe is coming apart.

The radio hissed unhelpfully.

"Russie. Let me talk. You flying. Aieeee!

Rabaha let out a squeak. Ten feet out her window the left engine top cowl seemed to have shattered. Heavy smoke pissed streams from around the manifolds and chugged out the exhaust.

"Timekeeper 1145 this is the village formerly known as RAF Aboukir. What is your heading?

Noshunse snapped his fingers inaudibly. Looked up, like to a voice from above. Rabaha took the trainee's yoke and signaled her readiness to help.

"Aboukir this is Timekeeper. We are 31°, 39' 50" north latitude. 29°, 24', 43" East. Heading southeast by east. Two hundred seventeen knots, and dropping. Altitude: nine thousand. We're losing four hundred feet per minute.

It was a British voice. RAF Aboukir had been shut down, officially, about four years prior. There should be nothing but sand and thirsty fields. Perhaps that explained the long pause at the other end of the conversation.

"RAF Aboukir, this is Timekeeper 1145. Come back.

A loud crack came from above and behind the cockpit.

"Cassie! Are you still there?

Rabaha yelled over her shoulder without taking her eyes off the gauges. A hoarse exclamation barely made it from Cas in the back. A deeper voice came on the radio.

"This is SAC Middle East Command, Aboukir Camp. Captain Andrews, USAF. Maintain your heading and identify yourself.

Strategic Air Command had no business in Egypt at an RAF base abandoned in 1946. The British had withdrawn to the Canal Zone under pressure. In the moment, Noshunse didn't give a rotted fig what the Americans were up to. The ceiling panel and insulation were collapsing Noshunse's line of sight. Rabaha was hammering the control panel with the heel of her palm. The air was acrid.

"We are Two Two Four Squadron, RAF, out of Gibraltar North Front. Coming down from Solenzara Base, Corsica, on special assignment. Colonel Russ Noshunse, British Army, seconded to RAF transmitting.

Whoever was at Aboukir apparently had all day. Noshunse saw this as a fantastic test of international cross-branch crisis communications. He smiled grimly. There was no sure way to know if the bomber would make land. His confidence in whoever was camped at Aboukir was higher. However, his confidence that Timekeeper would get a solid vouch from the next leg down the string-can telephone asymptotically approached nil. At the rate they were dropping, it hardly mattered.

"Get some damn lights in the field! Find out if we're friend or foe later, for fucks sake. We're coming down!

The expressive static was in his ear. The disintegrating bomber was swamping it.

"Right-Oh, Jack. We're lighting her up now. Welcome to Egypt, mate. We'll put the tea on.

The jovial American voice wasn't funny. Rabaha laughed a nervously aggressive laugh anyway. It changed to a screech as one of the windshield side panes vibrated free and shattered behind her. The wind whipsawed in. It helpfully began breaking stuff.

Somewhere not far north of Alexandria the second supercharger splintered and seized. Five miles from the headlands her engines burned across the sky. From the deck of |Le Falaise| she was among the brightest objects. A shooting star flashing past. Dropping to one side of the city's glow on the horizon. Hydraulics gone soft, metal skin shredding, turret blown off, ailerons flapping. Dropping, waggling, and smoking incontinently. Timekeeper 1145 was a demonic sight on a dangerous drunken trajectory.

The airfield squatters had driven out a row of jeeps with their headlights on. They set oil drums alight. Kerosene signaling lanterns, work lights umbilicaled to diesel generators, and military-grade flashlights. The hodgepodge wasn't slick. It would probably work. They shielded their eyes and watched the ball of flames on its final approach.

Across the barren expanse, several defanged fighter-bombers and other heavy metal huddled darkly under nets. They were intermixed with tented staging areas. Among the cargo, the silhouettes of towed field artillery. Beyond, the ragged shoreline. Small boats, drying nets, rough shacks. Along the gravel road, several Quonset huts and mobile operations trailers. Bicycles dropped. Telephone wires sagged. Equipment rusted. Chickens pecked.

"Aboukir, be advised, we are coming in hot with dangerous cargo and medical needs.

Noshunse's grim voice was the last transmission from the Buckmaster.

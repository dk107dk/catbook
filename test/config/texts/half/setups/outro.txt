All those beautiful words! Chronogram. Anagram. Bouts-Rim√©s, and echo verse. After all that, it comes down to just this: you and me. Are our stories not the rulers of all things?

By now I'm sure you can anticipate my next move. Indeed, I claim all these human events are entirely true. Soon you will begin to believe in the inexplicable. When that time comes you will realize, in fact, you had had no idea.

Unlike me, you will have the choice. You can simply walk away.

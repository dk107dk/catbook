>1919 - 1935 - Sadiki meets Noshunse in Cairo, Egypt

Many years passed. Births, marriages, deaths. Family fortunes grew as family lore grew dim. Time passes slowly and we are slowly changed by time.

Then one day the sun rose on the ragged western suburbs of Cairo. Like clockwork. It lit east-facing rooms with painted walls and woven hangings. Fires started. Coffee brewed. Bread burned. The siltified streets began to smoke.

Among the roughly two million people were two. At first, they were antipolarity magnets. One would open the front door. The other would scoot from the back. One would enter the guarded gate. The other would slip to the souk through passages where lesser skills made cheap cheroots change hands. One would sleep. The other, prowl. Not knowing each other, it was of no account. This went on for quite some time.

Major Russel Noshunse was, all in all, barely. He was barely a Major. His rank was only due to the vaguely expensive privileges of House Noshunse. Barely competent in matters Egyptian. He was right off the pier. A man of barely enough patience for the bureaucratic military he joined. Noshunse's impetuous enlistment was an allergic reaction to stuffy drawing rooms and the innuendo of family secrets handed down from the days of Arthur and Henry Noshunse. Excitement barely contained, he was ready to get cracking. Certain to start something. No one had told him what yet, so he set about looking.

1935 was hot. Egypt was restive. Cairo, rough, dirty, and growing over-quick. Noshunse snuffed his dress shoes in his first three weeks of spelunking through ginnels, cemeteries, and worksites. He learned the back ways his compatriots avoided. He got the information he wanted. And soon he got better footwear.

As he demonstrated competence, Noshunse's command expanded his reach. He was assigned a rag-top Morris CS8 with fat all-terrain tires. The centreline of his beat was Royal Dutch Shell's newly built Alexandria Desert Road. There was trouble on the new highway. Soon enough he ate less on base, switched to side gates, and, to all appearances, gave up sleep. His antipode and he were more often close.

The Major's driver was a local named Tariq Har Mahmoud. Tariq preferred Har, he said, for reasons. One of those reasons was apparently a retro sort of Egyptian pride. He didn't dwell on it. Noshunse didn't know for Har versus Tariq. He did know that Har knew when they had best smartly switch roads. They didn't argue about that. Everything else, yes.

In time, they argued the merits of denization versus naturalization. They argued the merits of local sugarcane versus Belgian chocolate. They vigorously disputed the merits of sleep over cricket. And they argued about the wetness of seawater and its questionable contribution to the salting of sea fish.

If all else failed, they argued about guns. Frequently. Was a pistol better than a knife? Could a man fight with two guns as effectively as with two knives? Were the Bedouin innately better sharpshooters due to their presumed slower heart rates? What caliber would it take to stop a horse at thirty paces? And, particularly, when would the Major equip his trusty native servant with the pistol that would one day be used by Har to save his eminent life? Russ rolled his eyes till they got sore. They kept driving.

The person with the opposing polarity to the Major was known to Har. Known vaguely, through a long chain of arranged marriages and family drunks. Ani Sadiki lived somewhere down in the turgid vortex of Egyptian Nationalism that Har's family genially subscribed to. He was well enough known for Har to occasionally encounter him across crowded rooms on feast days.

Sadiki was casually judged by those who barely knew him to be just a scrambling scholar and aggrieved sycophant. Those who knew Sadiki a little, for instance through long chains of familial relationships and drinking, saw someone with enough upper-class indications to merit a little one-upmanship by association on the limited occasions where that might be useful. Those who knew Sadiki better were, to a one, awed. Sadiki's close associates were few, silent, and feared.

Such is the makeup of many provocateurs. Sadiki could have instead been an imam, a ward politician, a bureaucrat with unsavory connections, or the like. Instead, he studied ancient Egyptian society. He was a reader of arcanum. What he read he assiduously compared to modern minutia. His writing was seen as a threat by nobody.

Sadiki was said to have taken the Ph.D. from a little-known French university he called Besançon. More nobody could say. Did he have money? Certainly not much. Was he a bit of a fop? Perhaps. Down at the heels? Well, yes. And yet, at the same time, powerfully connected. Not someone to take lightly, despite how much he sometimes seemed to beg to be.

"
One day, Har recognized Sadiki in the street. He and Noshunse were jammed up behind a donkey cart and a scaffolding company having a bad day. Har banged on the roll bar, honked even more, and waved him over.

"Ostāz!

Having attempted the Coptic for the honorific scholar-physician, Har quickly backed down to common |Masri|. His being oblivious to Sadiki's strong preference for Egyptian Aramaic in the market square was right on-brand. Nevertheless, seeing Noshunse, Sadiki switched his greeting to English.

"What a pleasure, my son. You have grown!

Sadiki was bluffing. He had no idea who Har was. Unlike many men with sharp edges, he expressed wide-eyed curiosity. His face said:

"I don't know who you are, but let's do this anyway!

His favorite disguise was a jovial:

"Yes, certainly so, but don't ask me to spell it!

Which was rich, given Sadiki was likely the only French Ph.D. within fifteen blocks of wherever he stood. Regardless, he made it work.

"Hey, hey, Major Russ, this is Dr. Sadiki. He family friend I told you. Would probably like your Belgian candies. Say hey-low!

Noshunse was hot. A rooster was vigorously attacking his right flank. He was in no mood.

"Pleased to meet you doctor. Honored. Any friend of Har.

He didn't sound honored. He didn't mean to not, but the rooster. Sadiki was interested that he had apparently come up in conversation. If the topic had been Belgian chocolate probably no harm done. But still.

"So now, Har, is it? Were you not answering to Tariq, I thought, last Eid-El-Kibr?

This was not an especially great leap. Sadiki knew a person known to him would accept the claim they had met on |Eid-El-Kibr|. Tariq from the uncommon Har was a bit more of a reach. The phonological guess worked. He got lucky.

"You know my parents. They give old name birthday presents. Where you see-to today?

||Har| is one of those little names. Little more than sounds. To Sadiki, however, Har sounded like another name for |Horus|. And that sounded interesting.

"I go to the library to find deep books to frighten off busybodies in the ahwa. And you? Where are you driving our esteemed friend to?

Noshunse was obviously as British as the day was long. He was only military if you actually interacted with him. Which Sadiki just had, so he knew.

"Har, the traffic. Look sharp, man!

Noshunse pointed. He moved in his seat. He slapped the canvas by way of hurrying them along. The rooster salient had been beaten back. The equipment had been dragged off the road. An opening conjured impossibly through the crowd.

"Grand to meet you, doctor. May our paths cross again.

Noshunse had only glancingly met Sadiki's eye. Neither he nor Har heard Sadiki's reply. The doctor, too, had wished they would again cross paths.

In fact, he would make sure of it.

Despite his sketchy credentials, Dr. Ani Sadiki was a serious man. He was not a fan of cartoons. Regardless, he was living through the dawn of the golden age of animation. Mickey had arrived. Sadiki just didn't know it.

Sadly, as one unschooled in the garish arts, Sadiki was not fully up to speed on the full range of physics available. That said, most physicists were also not, so he was in good company. In some ways, despite abstaining from the filmic arts, Sadiki was a bit ahead of that illustrious pack. For Sadiki had, unknowingly, come to terms with at least some of the new physics.

So-called cartoon physics is a big deal. The world was then receiving its first mass tutelage in the subject. Books had not yet been written. Articles explicating had not yet appeared in academic journals. In many ways, the world was unready. It is not, however, in the nature of laws of physics to hold their effects in abeyance pending a full review.

Presumably, Niels Bohr and fellow travelers had access to much the same inputs as Sadiki. Some of their thinking, what was soon to be known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, was undoubtedly informed by the seemingly bizarrely exaggerated physics of animated shorts. Would they admit it? Even behind closed doors? Unlikely. Academia is a brute and competitive locale. It wants no truck with light entertainment. And academics are not over fond of keeping things short.

Sadiki's insight was to intuit that the gross observer effects commonly exhibited by cartoons were not in fact exaggerations. Wile E. Coyote is great example. Repeatedly running off cliffs is perverse behavior. Still, his ability to fall only when an observer, namely him, thinks to take a measurement, fits the phantasmagorical laws of physics. Cartoon physics or man-on-the-street physics? Actually both. The Venn diagram is tight. Who's to say that a camera-free single-observer absent-minded airborne excursion in Real Life would have any different outcome?

We can't easily say because the experimental setup is fraught. Asking people to run off cliffs leads to budget-busting costs. Measuring the arc of travel precisely in a way that doesn't trigger wave function collapse requires kit unavailable from laboratory equipment catalogs. And telling the experimental subject to think about the bird receding in front of you, not the void opening below you is easy. But it doesn't work. All these, and more, are hard problems.

As far as we can say, Sadiki didn't have any interest in running off cliffs. He did have an interest in running the British Imperial Juggernaut off a cliff. Or, more practically, running it out of Egypt. This had been his long-term project. Decades. It would ultimately consume his entire life. It began the day seven-year-old Ani saw his father's warhorse-stomped body from between British boots. If new physics would speed the day, he said bring it.

Now, cartoon physics turns out to have significant historical, political, economic, and military value. Word circulated in the mid-1920s. Whispers from the south. Slowly whispers congealed into rumors. At first the rumors were ignored. In certain circles, though, the rumors gained attention. In a country at war with itself, its Turkish overlords, the French, the British, the Italians, restive natives of Egyptian Sudan, and innumerable religious groups, tribes, and commercial powers, rumors that rose above the tumult were invariably interesting.

First, they said there were special eyes that saw hidden things. Then it was said the eyes were controlled by a mystic. Some believers said the eyes saw the future. Others said the eyes actually determined the future. And still others claimed the eyes recast the past. These abilities were said to be embodied in wonderful artifices. Essentially machines embodied in works of art. Not unlike how clocks may be both complex machines with celestial powers and also works of beauty.

Said like that, the rumors might have suggested the dawning of a new technology. The then-new X-ray photography saw what was hidden. The equally new radio control linked objects with unseen forces. Technology was exploding worldwide. Egypt, however, was not a technical hotbed. Unsurprisingly, fantastic rumors were not seen to herald fantastic new tech. Rather the rumors were ascribed to the gods. In this case, the ancient Egyptian gods, of course.

A younger Ani Sadiki had been a small-time saboteur. He assembled a small band of angry young men. They had a serious hobby: blowing up British men and materiel. Sadiki's band worked their way up and down the Nile. They labored, got paid, bought inputs, mixed explosives, and killed people. It was a hand-to-mouth existence. They slept rough, begged, and stole. After a little killing, they melted away and moved on. Rinse and repeat.

In the hot season of 1920, Ani Sadiki and his cousin Haani al-Muna were picking through the remains of an armored car. Their gang had destroyed it with a lucky improvised grenade. Glass, gunpowder, flint, lead. Three bodies, a Lewis machine gun, and a shattered radio telephone had been extracted. Selmi Gamal dragged off the gun. He had quickly returned to dig out seven fully loaded ninety-seven-round pan magazines. Nearly two minutes of buzzing mayhem! Haani was busy collecting intel. Papers out of wallets and pockets, a promising little notebook, and a passel of passes, badges, and IDs.

Sadiki kicked at a battered strong box through what had been the right rear door. It popped. He took a long gouge up his calf. Momentarily he paused to resent his blood mixing with that of the three slain Europeans. He pulled his leg back. Slid down on his back. Reached as far as he could to pull whatever it was in that box, out. A small canvas bag. Military green. Within, a ragged handkerchief, crumpled pounds sterling, and a once rather nice Egyptian cotton shirt wadded around a wood box with a fitted lid. The box would not open. It had to wait.

There was generally little early traffic on the river road through Wadi Fatirah in Abu Zawal District. That and several hairpins made for a good ambush. Fatirah was about forty miles north of Aswan. The village was at the edge of the narrow cultivated swath running along the temple town Kom Ombo, formerly known as Nubt, the city of gold, on the east bank. "City" was a stretch. More of an agglomeration of villages and stony roads. A place British squads passed through on their way to cause strife elsewhere.

They debated setting the car alight. Decided it was well to call attention to the kill. Before they got it lit, another car. Barhoum Saleh whistled. Haani pulled Sadiki's arm. They dove through brambles and up a wash. Breathlessly met the others. Distributed the proceeds between the five of them. Stunted trees, brush, and a low erosion cliff forced them south. They made for Kom Ombo staying well off the road.

This was how Sadiki came to possess his first eye of Sobek-Horus. How it came to be in the box is not important. Neither is the box's presence in a safe in the back of an improvised armored car on a lonely road. Those were just facts.

What is important is that Sadiki would first inspect his spoils in the home of a grizzled partisan Pharaonist. A victim of British colonial brutality. And it was important that this fellahin patron recognized the eye for what it was. The wise man recognized it because he lived in the same village as the great dual temple of Horus and Sobek. And it was of paramount importance that the temple housed dozens of mummified crocodiles and a secretive retrograde culture of crocodile worship.

That night the guerrillas slipped into Nabil El Ahlan's family compound. They piled their weapons and belongings at the backdoor for a quick exit. There was food. Relating the destruction of the armored staff car, Sadiki brought out the wooden box. Nabil was interested. He fetched a chisel. When Sadiki cracked the box and held up the eye, Nabil audibly caught his breath.

It glowed deep lustrous green in the candlelight. The iris and sclera flashed. Sadiki smelled heavy machine oil on his fingers. The piece was heavy. While obviously worked primarily in stone, the surface had the texture and forms of hide. Gazing into the eye he realized he had lost track of time. Handing the eye to Nabil for inspection was an effort.

Nabil took it gingerly. He brought it close before suddenly rearing back. Turned the eye around at arm's length. Sadiki realized Nabil held the eye as if it were |eish baladi| stolen from the oven, the tips of his fingers in a tiny dance of pain. Nabil pointed to the box. He released the eye to Sadiki, saying nothing.

That first night, Sadiki lay with the box by his head. Unsure if he had slept, he removed the eye. He gazed deeply into it. His senses did not make obvious time's passing.

In the morning Nabil gave Sadiki bread and beans. They walked two streets and across a dry crick to the temple wall. Monolithic sandstone complemented the arid sky. They passed through columns and stelae with crocodilian lunettes. Down a depressed open-air corridor. Into a twenty by thirty-foot room.

Dark after the sun, the room was lit from recesses with tin-backed candles. Ranks of benches before a low altar. Two men sat cross-legged. They dressed plainly and appeared to be doing sums. Sadiki instinctively thought of tax collectors. The thought made his cheek twitch involuntarily.

As Nabil went forward, Sadiki looked around. Unsurprisingly, there were crocodiles. Painted and carved. There were illegible letterforms. A small passage was blocked by a dark curtain. The tallowed air didn't move. The men spoke with muted gestures. Nabil came back to him.

"The deacons would have you show them your find. They will say what it is, if it is known.

Sadiki, anxious to get out of the airless monachal cave, nodded. He approached, opened the box, and extracted the eye. He found himself reluctant to hand it over, or even put it down. Nevertheless, he placed it on the table.

The reaction was immediate. They pulled back. One lost his balance. Papers scattered to the floor. One of the nearby candles went out in what was probably just a dramatic coincidence. Both men spoke softly in an unsynchronized way, apparently to themselves. They slowly leaned in.

"Your presence just now would be unwelcome but that you bear the gift. They know the object. They don't know what to make of you.

Nabil interpreted the scene for Sadiki.

"I can tell them what to make of me. All they have to do is ask.

Sadiki grabbed the eye. Held it up. Then thrust it back in its box and returned the box to the canvas bag. He stepped back and to the doorway.

"Nabil, come. Perhaps we will speak with these again another time.

By mid-morning, the men had figured out the Louis gun. Barhoum had dislocated a finger in the firing mechanism. Haani had cuts. They took the gun and a magazine, and headed away from the river. A couple of miles upland they found an ancient quarry. The men fired carefully, to conserve ammunition. It was powerful. They were gleeful. Returning, they ate well.

The second night Sadiki learned much. He revisited the quarry. Lofting high above the scene. A new man was there. A mud-caked Gurkha Rifle scout lying prone behind scrub. Glasses to his eyes watching Sadiki and his men. Slowly the gang set up the gun. They fired a test bullet. Silent huzzahs. Then Sadiki saw himself crouch behind the Louis. He watched himself sight it, remembering how he had in fact done.

Then something new. Dreaming Sadiki watched shooting Sadiki rotate the gun almost ninety degrees. He raised its attitude. His aim was more purposeful. The sighting more careful. His finger closed. The Louis barked and spat. A longer blast than he had shot. A full quarter pan expended. The Gurkha slumped behind smashed binoculars and shredded brush. Blood pooled.

Sadiki woke with a start. His arm was sore from the chugging Louis recoil. The eye observed him. He carefully put it back in its box.

Haani and Sadiki left the compound at five-thirty. In half an hour they came to the path at the far end of the quarry where the guerrillas had trialed the gun. Sectioning the ground, they searched for what they knew they shouldn't find.

When Haani found the dead Rifle they crouched, staring at the body. Time stopped. Then they stood at the same moment, ran to where the gunners had lain, and dropped to the dirt feeling for cartridges. There were few casings. At the body, far more lead than they remembered shooting.

They shivered. That was the moment they knew. They knew, even as they knew their memories were changing. They instinctively knew that if they looked again they would find more casings.

It took some time to really sink in. More time for the other gang members to believe. And yet more time for Sadiki and Haani to think how to exploit the new physics they did not yet understand. That nobody understood.

They consulted the crocodile priests. They engaged credible villagers. They called distant Coptic family members to the scene. As their plans solidified they began recruiting fighters, proselytizing believers, and searching for the source of the eye. More eyes were obtained. Experiments were run. A worshipful congregation was raised. Things snowballed.

Seeing the faith take hold, Sadiki began whipping the worshipers into a nativist frenzy. Random chance or divine intervention, he suddenly had the means to his own private army. He set about sharpening knives and gathering influence. His efforts soon enough took him ninety-five miles north to a backwater of Luxor named Reed Boatworks. The source of the strange new physics that Sadiki would use to liberate Egypt.

At least that had been the plan. By the time he met a distracted Major Russ Noshunse many years later in a crowded Cairo market square, much to his great dissatisfaction, the plan had changed.

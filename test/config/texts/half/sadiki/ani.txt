1882 - 1894 - Sadiki is born near Alexandria, Egypt

"Where did I come from?

The answer to Cori's conundrum began many years ago, unsurprisingly, in Egypt.

Saeed Amir Sadiki was proudly a |yizbashi|, the Head of a Hundred. His company was attached to Fort Adda, Alexandria, at the headlands above the harbor. On the morning of July 11, 1882, Saeed was startled awake with a hangover of sugarcane-sweetened |bouza| and beer. His first thought was to hide the dregs of his intoxication from his Islamic superiors. His second thought was to follow the running feet and shouting. It was six a.m. By two p.m. fifty of his men would be dead, the rest scattered, the fort destroyed.

The first fusillades were mobile. Ships of the line crisscrossed the point laying down a punishing fire. Later the gunships simply dropped anchor, close-in, athwart, and point-blank hammered the walls. After destroying Adda, the British sea bombing shifted methodically to the west. It continued for hours as the city burned. Meanwhile, Saeed rocked on his heels in the rubble. Ears ringing, shirt shredded, shoulders dislocated. Bleeding from a dozen cuts and perforations. He had no idea what had just happened. He didn't feel any closer to god.

"
Prior to Alexandria, Saeed had risen from a fellah's discrimination to the self-respect of a foot soldier of the Khedive. He marched to the northern border of Egyptian Sudan under the generalship of Muhammad Ali. In 1878, through fortuitous adverse circumstances, Saeed rose to |mülâzım-ı sani|, subaltern to his captain.

Soon after, a rebellious local tribesman, a |bdshbuzuq| conscript, upgraded Saeed again. He did this by knifing Saeed's captain directly in front of the |binbashi|'s tent. Saeed without thinking disemboweled the offender. The battalion commander, whose tent flaps had just been covered in gore, immediately inquired as to which company the competent young gallant led. Saeed, sensing an opportunity rare in the offing, showed great presence of mind.

"Sir, I am awaiting the assignment of a company command

This flexible interpretation of the facts in short order landed Saeed his one hundred. The men under him quickly learned to admire his drive and fairness. At their level of the army, Saeed's humble background was a credit. As the low-born |felláheen| Ahmed Urabi’s mutiny gathered strength in the capital region, Saeed’s background led him and his company back north to take part in the uprising. While not political, he was more than willing.

On the barge north, Saeed slept on the open deck with the rank and file. In the morning he took weak and hungry coffee with his troops. Eventually, they marched to the dry coast from Cairo to Alexandria. The company augmented the Adda battery just in time for Saeed to lose his eardrums to British adventurism fighting to uphold an economic status quo that infrequently favored any fellah.

That day Saeed learned the mechanics of cannonade from replacing cannoneers who died. Eventually all but Saeed did. How he survived he couldn't say. His company was crushed, his superiors dead, the city collapsed, the |felláheen| dream in full helter-skelter retreat. That night Saeed, carrying nothing with him, simply walked away.

His path took him out of the city, first due south, then northeast. He stayed in rough land well off the road. Once clear of the city he made for the coast. Breathing salt, treading sand. In the midday heat, he longed for the wrap of a |shemagh|. Presently, by wrick and bend, he passed into Beheira Governorate, eventually reaching Edku Town.

Edku spread along the shore of Lake Idku where it creeps up to the sea. The western reaches were the extreme of the Nile watershed. Once known as |Jackat|, The Hills, it had in times past been strategically important to the provincial seat, Ra Amenati. Saeed arrived at a low point in a long history. Men carted dried salt and freshwater fish to burgeoning coastal cities. Complications passed by on the road to business elsewhere. It was quiet.

That evening Saeed fell burnt face first through the reeds. It was good that he reached fresh water when he did. He had come twenty-seven parched miles. A young woman, Shehata Atalla, found Saeed. Head twisted, cupped in mud, mouth open. Flies fed in his wounds. Seeing his chest move, she dropped her washing and ran.

Forty minutes later Saeed's raw eyes opened. He was in the home of Rushdi Abdou Atalla. Coptic elder of the village. A healer, toolsmith, fisherman, and quiet pharaonic partisan. Saeed felt Shehata carefully cleaning sand from his wounds. Rushdi watched silently. Later, they ate flatbread and salted fish. The family took him in. In time, Saeed recovered. He was indebted. He stayed. In time he learned a trade.

"
One day, about twelve years later, Saeed saved his boy's life by exchanging it for his own. Shehata sent young Ani skipping after his father, carrying the cotton-wrapped meal Saeed had forgotten on the kitchen table. Ani was barefoot. He ran down the alleys towards the boats on the other side of town. Around a tanner's shop, past the weaver's dyeing vats. He caught a glimpse of his father and his young cousin Haani al-Muna crossing the main road bearing nets on a portage pole. Ani ran faster.

Seeing a small British Army convoy approaching rapidly, Saeed slowed and moved to the side of the road. Horse guard and cavalry carriage running ahead of heavy wagons. Saeed stopped whistling. Did he hear his name? Ani’s high voice and running feet came to him, even as the hooves grew louder ahead. Haani shouted. Saeed twisted under the pole and looked.

His boy! Ani ran breathless round the far side of the road at the curve. He was almost there. Focused only on his father. Even as men scrambled to get out of the street. A warning rifle shot. Ani still ran, heedless of the approaching vehicles and commotion.

Saeed dropped the pole. Knocked over a man rushing to get out of the road. Yelled for Ani to stop. The wheels neared. Saeed threw himself across the street. Slipping, losing traction. Stretched every muscle out over the dirt. Head and shoulders landed hard against the running boy. The street slammed into his chest. Ani's thin body crashed backward into a stall, concussing his head on a sandstone block. Saeed's torso hit the ground milliseconds before the lead horse jumped and less than a second before the right front wheel crushed his ribcage.

When Ani opened his eyes some minutes later the street was bloody. British helmets scattered. Warhorses rearing. A grenadier fired down an alley. Bedouin shouts and screaming. The lead carriage had tipped over and crushed a fishmonger's stall. Another wagon slewed side-on. Its broken horse lay shot. His father's deformed body lay tangled half under the rear wheels of the second vehicle. Ani’s head swam. A high black boot kicked his legs out of the street. He fainted.

Ani Saeed Sadiki was not yet eight. That day he began the search for vengeance that would consume the rest of his life.

***
The Cairo-Alexandria Express had a single point of failure: the tracks. Ani Sadiki liked that. Having fallen himself due to a single point of failure, he looked for the same in others. People who zero in on one thought to the exclusion of others are often compared to a stopped watch, correct twice a day. In Sadiki's case, he was a stopped watch that was rarely wrong. Single points of failure are everywhere.

Haani, on the other hand, well, he liked the canal. For the same reason. In principle, a small number of ships sunk in just the right places would shut down the British Empire's aorta. Done right, the impact on the imperial economy could be immense. There were military considerations as well. It would be a powerful blow. And yet, as Sadiki repeatedly hammered home, to do the thing right would take the coordinated sinking of no less than five large ships. Preferably seven. And even the larger number would only cause hemorrhage for at most a fortnight. A hard blow, yes. But unless repeatedly followed up, a glancing one.

Destroying the Express, though, would be comparatively easy. If the cars were chock-a-bloc with white convalescents, holidaymakers, and adventurers, so much the better. As news, it would be grand. As a blow against the colonial machine, incidental. However, the important consideration, at least in Sadiki's mind, was the notoriety they stood to gain. Points to personal credibility meant more to his rebuilding than a barely perceivable percentage loss in gross imperial product.

And rebuilding was definitely needed. Sadiki and Haani retained only their para-military core, much shrunken and dried. The shattering of their single point of failure had led to a head-spinning collapse. The six months after the disappearance of the savant oracular girl Ktt Hathor, known as Half, had been hard. More disappearances, disappointments, bad luck, and defections.

Sadiki had rapidly lost the cult's followers, the newfound wealth and property they had channeled to him, and, most importantly, the weaponized new physics. The risen Sobek Cult had been beheaded. Militaristic leaders were jailed. The Sobek eyes were loose in the wind. Well, all but that first one. That one Sadiki still had. Yet even that last remaining eye had reverted to an all but dead lump of beautiful art. All else was gone. It was a specular nadir.

Truly, the fallen fall hard, if they are good at what they do.

"
Sadiki's day started at two-thirty a.m. He, Haani al-Muna, Selmi Gamal, and Ibrâhîm Yaqub dressed in the loose black robes of |ulama|. Pistols tucked into their |serwals|. Lightweight home-sewed bandoleers, pikal knives, and shanks.  Ibrâhîm looped a short studded hard-wood truncheon down his back. All showed |mas'baha| beads of muted colors at the sleeve or neck.

They left Haani's apartment by the back stairs carrying bags of precut safety fuses, blasting cap detonators, and simple tools. They would pick up their explosives near the station. Insects went to sleep. Dogs woke. The streets began to fill. They walked three miles.

The simple plan was this: blow up the train. Sadiki and company would ride the lightly guarded Express to Alexandria. They would attack at |Al Khatatbah|, a desert trading depot, at that time barren. At Khatatbah, the Express's tracks ran between a canal and a desert road at the foot of a forty-meter rise. The desert reached over the rise with its claws out.

There, the gang would infiltrate the first- and second-class cars to lay explosives. They would then hurry back to the top of third class, uncouple it, and stop it. Seconds later, the first- and second-class cars would detonate with emphasis. Sadiki's team would exfiltrate over the and meet up with partisans. They would make for the Siwa Oasis, a restive pocket four hundred miles west, deep in the Western Desert.

Truly, they thought it would work. Plans laugh at the optimism of fanatics.

"
Major Noshunse also assessed the landscape of weaknesses sprawled across the lower Nile. His Commander liked the Suez as a target. After all, in the war, he had overseen a vigilant camel-borne defense of the east bank between Timsah and Great Bitter Lake. The Ottomans and their rabble consorts feared his 92nd Punjabis and shouldn't Noshunse aspire to same? Pan-Arabists would come in the night, he said. They would swarm the ships passing through the sand. The defense must be alert and reinforcements at the ready. Noshunse aspired to knock off early for pickup cricket and therefore did not disagree.

There were many such tiresome conversations. General quarters, briefing rooms, canteen. The Detachment paid its officers to think from the Army Field Manual. Noshunse preferred to work from sketched maps, district tabloids, and handbills. His attitude and deportment became brittle. He retreated to the street. Tactically, of course.

Noshunse pretended to liaise with the Port Said barracks. He pretended to search for miscreants. He pretended to unsavory practices. He pretended to run trucks across the desert. He pretended to smuggle from Alexandria to the Gulf of Aqaba. In many cases, he winked. In other cases, he nodded noncommittally. He learned to smoke in a way that almost forced people to bum cigarettes.

One day, Noshunse dressed haphazardly in his worst everything and broken shoes. He slipped out of the compound by the back. Moving quickly, sweat boiling his pores. He threaded a deep |ashwaiiyat| mile of alleys to a low tavern he had never seen. He bought hard liquor with dirty specie. As he staggered out the back he splashed drink all over his shirt.

Behind the privy, he spat at a goat. An oil drum blocked the alley. He leaned close behind. Up against the adobe and sandstone. Whipped his head around, cracking it. Ground his forehead. Hammered it. Plaster dropped. And again striking the wall hard with his cheekbone. Dazed. He staggered into the heat of the street and collapsed in front of a surprised camel.

"My name is Har.

Noshunse's left eye opened. The right wouldn't budge.

"You scared my camel.

The boy self-designated Har held out a wide cup with dark liquid. The room was narrow and dim. Rattan and dust. Cotton worn to silk. Carved wood and packing materials. He was on a rug-covered divan that smelled of coffee-fed poultry. A pole-and-curtain triptych awkwardly carved a space through the clutter that might have been for prayers. Or it might have hosted a marionette show. It was a confusing space.

He tried to rise. His hand shot out. Har spilled the hot liquid on Noshunse's booze-sticky shirt. Both gasped and flinched. The cup shattered. Noshunse lost his balance on the loose rug, crashed down, and cut his left hand on the shards. There was confusion.

That was how Noshunse and Har came together. Not the perfect pairing, but effective. After they got clear that Noshunse was a Major and Har less than a private. After they worked out that Har was a local and Noshunse less than helpless. After they understood that the British Army could pay Har but could not actually know he existed. After they sorted out that Noshunse was not going to gift Har a camel-blasting sidearm any time soon. After all that, they started arguing.

Har's family tapestry was a riot of color. They were descended from nomadic desert traders grafted onto Coptic Mediterranean smugglers. The threads were woven throughout Egypt, Sinai, Jordan, Cyprus, Aden, Persia, and further still. Tall men, strong women, and reedy, wily, irrepressible children. Aggressive storytellers, liars, allegorists, and dissemblers, all.

Har insisted, unprompted, that his great uncle had captained a phalanx of armed scout gliders for the Italian infantry in Algeria. Har's second aunt apparently ruled the harem of the Grand Bey of Tunis with an iron fist. His step-brother's half-nephew, a trained Anastenaria fire-dancer, worked the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields south of Suez fighting blowout fires barefoot. Noshunse was certain some disreputable barefoot cousin fishing off the |Corniche El-Nil| was telling his friends Har was working undercover for a heavily armed British spy on a mission to execute pan-Arabist threats to the King's empire. Which was actually true, so really, of all of it, who knew?

Noshunse took Har with him up east, casing the canal. Har had the eye. He spotted the bights below the wharves where the oily flow from massive culverts big enough for cormorant boats bloomed into the channel. Where from? Har explained that you could travel miles under the Port Said streets. He spotted sand bars before they colored the water. He haggled mercilessly with scows, feluccas, and tugs. He was surprisingly useful.

By this time Noshunse was even more convinced they were wasting time on the wrong leg of the Cairo-Alexandria-Port Said triangle.

"Hey, hey. What the thing are we doing? This boats is nothing to see. Wasting time for fun? No guns here.

So, the Express. But when? Who? How? As it happened, quite unexpectedly, Har delivered that information.

"
Har came upon his distaff elder uncle Ammut Sawiris.

"Ya, eh akhbaar young Seagull-egg-eater. Didn't I see you in the market the other day? Don't lie to me.

Ammut was cracking pistachios in the doorway of the building where another uncle ran a second-hand hardware business. He was as much a busybody as the Nile was a river.

"Massa elkheer, my best moving-cart-tire-changing-father's brother. Is the doorway available for use or will I receive pistachios in part compensation for my inconvenience?

He received pistachios.

"Yes, yes. But I did. When you were looking the other way. Looking like you were casing the butcher in the hope of stealing vegetables.

Har was sure he did not remember such an incident. Though, he pointed out, if anyone could steal vegetables from under goat shank it was him.

"Your inestimably munificent point is what, oh Champion-forger-of-dogs-breath?

Obsequiously deferential respect paid, more pistachios changed hands.

"Well, little One-eyed-thief-who-steals-art-from-blind-men, at that time you were not situationally aware enough to save yourself from being mugged by infants because, as I see it, you were attempting to insult the young woman by your side.

Now Har was back on his heels. He hadn't realized family members knew he had been recently mugged by infants. Oh, the embarrassment! This had better not get back to that young woman. It might make her hourly proposals of marriage impossible to beat back.

"This matter, Breaker-of-the-legs-of-the-camel-he-rides, is a concern of yours I had dearly hoped you were of sufficient intelligence to grasp months ago. The young woman is but a police inspector who was seeking your whereabouts. In anticipation of your generous reward of pistachios, I declined to give you up.

Har looked pointedly at the bag of nuts.

This back and forth might have continued into the evening, had there been sufficient pistachios. In the end, Ammut let him go with a promise to bring beer and pine nuts to a card game the next Wednesday.

At that time Har realized he was late to meet the same young not-actually-a-police-inspector girl of the name Shanameena. However, by then, the die had been cast. Attempting to mollify the endearingly pissed-off Shanameena with the remaining pistachios was a lost cause unworthy of the speeding minutes spent in her presence.

At the card game, Har heard many things. His uncles and cousins talked of neighborhood politics, their many mostly shady businesses, the Cairo camel races, and war. They talked about theft, love, insulting behavior, and religious strife. There was word of profits, partnerships, and piracy. And they talked about a gang of domestic terrorists that were driving the Sultanate's internal security departments to distraction.

The gang's doings were of great interest to the card players. The saboteurs were Egyptian nationalists. As was fully half of Har's family. The other half – Har's half – being more cosmopolitan were mostly interested in romance, adventure, and making money.

Har listened attentively. Reading between the lines, drawing unwarranted assumptions, and jumping prematurely to conclusions, he heard a few things he thought he knew. The leader of the band of agitators out to kill foreigners sounded oddly familiar. Har's family had wide connections. The central figure sounded suspiciously like one of them. The so-called crocodile scholar. The unassuming and somewhat mysterious Belgian chocolate-eating Doctor Ani Sadiki.

"
On the morning of the attack, Sadiki insisted the team eat. Ibrâhîm Yaqub was young and looked edgy. This was only his second operation. Haani al-Muna was starving. That was normal. They bought |taameya|, |kaek|, |jameed|, and coffee. Ibrâhîm used all the condiments available. Selmi wrapped up his |taameya|, stuck it in his pocket, and went to find the explosives.

In those days, as ever, humans worked the Egyptian rock with violence. In the 1930s there were steam shovels and gas-driven air hammers. Men forced dry cracks with blows. Parched hands dyed white with powdered limestone and |ṭalq| jammed dynamite into charge holes. Fractured blocks, oil, water, blood.

The destruction industries were rife with Egyptians. As you would expect, in Egypt. It was too easy. They had just asked. A little money had changed hands. The result was twenty pounds of cardboard, diatomaceous earth, and nitroglycerin. Each rough tube package was about two pounds. Give or take four megajoules. Enough to destroy a main battle tank. Selmi quickly divided the death into two small black leather briefcases. Nobody looked twice. Selmi was back in twenty-five minutes. The Express would leave in another thirty.

The locomotive was a black 2-6-0 superheated Mogul 545-class. Built in Glasgow by the North British Locomotive Company. The steam boiler was shiny black enamel. The tanks and cab gloss had faded to matte with the hot blowback. On the driver's door the garish blood-red shield and gold crown of the Khedivate. Below that in smoky white, locomotive number five-hundred-ninety. The first- and second-class cars were wine, burgundy, and burnt maroon. Behind them, two third-class cars and one mail car were in flat hunter green and black. There was a short brake van.

They boarded with tickets at five minutes to the hour. While the four of them would not have drawn much attention, twos were better. Sadiki took Ibrâhîm. Haani took Selmi. The former had second-class tickets. The others, third. Sadiki took seats as far to the front as possible. Haani walked Selmi to the third car but then took a seat near the back of the fourth, not far from the van. In this way, the two sets of two conspirators had eyes on all of the carriages.

The five-ninety pulled out of Ramses Station on time. Noshunse arrived just as it started pulling. He had to run. Ducked onto the brake van's trailing platform pretty much just in time. Chest heaving. He threw his battered hat to the deck. Pulled off his steaming twill jacket, slamming it on a nail apparently angled for the purpose. The nail made a small tear. Tore at his shirt at the neck and leaned over the rail into the breeze. It would take three miles just to cool down. He guessed he might have ten to spare.

Fifteen minutes later they crossed the Nile heading west. Soon, a tight correction north, towards Alexandria. Urbanity subsided. Dry |ʻIzbats|, wet fields. The train runs up the Nile to |Jizīrat el Sha'îr 'Ez Zâyid Pasha|. Noshunse loved the names, despite his admittedly pathetic Egyptian Aramaic. Master Poet Zâyid's Island? He momentarily pondered if he cared how little he knew of the language.

Loosened his sidearm. Checked his boot knife. Slipped his left-hand fingers into a |Sher Panja|, the Sikh's brass knuckles. His right fist could take care of itself.

The Express reached and turned along |Rayâh el Beḥeira| and a smaller canal that ran parallel to the west, then north. The Beḥeira and its left flank channel were a pair of liquid tracks running fifty feet apart containing a bank for the iron tracks. The two channels would run true for about fifteen miles before they diverged. Bridges were infrequent. Then the train would follow the larger Beḥeira. It was after that divide that whatever it was would happen. Until then, the waterways complicated the attackers' escape options.

Noshunse had a theory. After the channels diverged there were three places where the desert met the train. |Al Khatatbah| at a small bridge over the flanking canal as it peeled away. About ten miles north at the |Modiriyat Al-Tahrir| Train Station. Or at the marginal fields of |Ezbet Deif Alla Sultan| village. Seeing as the insurgents would likely not appreciate the connotation of an attack at Guest of the Sultan village, he ruled that out. Of the remaining two, Khatatbah was the wilder.

Har and Noshunse had scouted the line. They noted Khatatbah's obvious escape to the desert. There was a hard-pack trail up from the rickety bridge. After a quarter of a mile, it curved up and over the rise. A mile beyond that heading west it became impossible for Noshunse to see. Har, of course, said he saw it plain as the "eye of your head" and laughed at him.

They had moved on to Modiriyat Al-Tahrir, a somewhat more built area. Noshunse didn't see it. Why increase your risk to make a statement to relatively few observers? If spectators were needed the Express wouldn't make it out of Cairo. Which now they had, so |Al Khatatbah|.

"
On the van platform, Noshunse pulled his now ripped field jacket on over his shoulder holster. In heavy canvas pants, an impolite shirt, and desert boots under the haircut of a roustabout he did not look second-class, let alone first. On the other hand, he was white, large, and could make a face, so would get further than some. He took a deep breath opened the brake van door and stepped over the couplers. He marched boldly into the last car as if he belonged there.

They were at least halfway to Khatatbah. Perhaps more.

Noshunse moved slowly. He tried to appear unthreatening. He didn't believe the trouble he was seeking would lurk at the very back of the train. He continued steadily towards the top of the car. He had been only half right. There was now a dangerous man behind him.

As he approached the third car Noshunse had an idea. He would hold the door behind with his back foot as he opened the forward door. He would then kick the door behind him shut while slamming the door ahead. In both cases, he hoped, making quite a bit of noise. And hopefully without him falling under the wheels. The goal was to see who reacted and how. That he could only look in one direction at a time was a drawback. But playing the gambit twice would tip his hand too obviously.

Up in second-class, Ibrâhîm was tugging on Sadiki's sleeve. They had just a few minutes to plant and arm the explosives.

"Doctor! Sir! It's time to go.

Sadiki was already in motion. He pulled one of the two briefcases from under his seat. Ibrâhîm had the other. Ibrâhîm handed Sadiki one of the small shoulder bags with half the detonators. Sadiki looked back slowly. The conductor was was thirty feet away. Nobody was looking. Ibrâhîm leaned into the aisle, looking forward.

"There is no one coming. Go quick. Strike a blow.

Sadiki took a breath. He wasn't nervous. The planning had been enjoyable, as is buying the ingredients for dinner. It was time. He got up slowly. Picked up the briefcase. Willed himself to look like the respected academic he only pretended to be. He started forward.

"
Har had started in the same direction hours earlier. At the start of the journey, he was bored. Driving out of Cairo would only become interesting if there were complications. Without the Major in the vehicle, it was possible he would be stopped and have to talk his way out.

Why was he driving a Royal Officer's truck? He was paid to do it. Where was his employer? He couldn't say, his was but to drive. Was he aware that driving ordnance through the city center was prohibited without an escort? No, he was not aware. Neither did he have knowledge of what was contained in the cases with the English letters. He didn't read.

All of this was easy enough in daydreaming. Actually talking his way out of anything in English just made him argumentative. That might not have gone well. As it happened, Har made it out of Cairo just fine.

Once out of the urban center, Har was in his element. The Morris had a full tank of gas, two jugs in the back, a modified six-cylinder inline side valve making almost one-hundred brake horsepower, and falafel. He stomped, it slid, the day was young, psammomies got the hell out of the way. Har handily beat the Express to the Khatatbah area. For Har, that was where the trouble started.

Har backtracked from Khatatba a few miles and pulled the Morris over. The spot Har chose was about in view of Abu Ghalib station. He had attempted to get the Morris under a stumpy tree. It was hot.

Without much effort, Har convinced himself that the heat might be bad for the cargo. He told himself he had better have a look. There were three army-issue gray-green wood boxes. All locked. Noshunse had given Har the truck keys on a ring. Naturally, he had forgotten to remove the padlock keys.

Inside the boxes Har found his beating heart. Crossed himself without knowing what it meant. Mumbled incantations to gods long dead, intermixed with choice cuss words. He took a breath. Then he plundered. A Webley Revolver. A service Pattern 1914 Enfield. An oily Thompson submachine gun. And a six-box of Mills bomb hand grenades. Did he need that much arsenal? Surely not. Har dropped his loot in the front passenger seat with a wide goofy grin.

After awhile he calmed down and put the seat back to wait. The heat was a weight on his body. Before long Har was asleep. He dreamed he was riding the roof of a train cradling the Tommy gun and waving to a greatly impressed Shanameena. The insurgents wore gray, she wore blue.

Har woke with a start to a train whistle warning the crossing. He banged his elbow painfully on the metal door. Ten seconds later, fully awake. He saw the Express passing Abu Ghalib at speed. His foot was tangled in the accelerator. The Morris wouldn't start. That was frustrating because Har was sure he had just seen a window smashed out of fourth-class. Pumped the clutch spasmodically. Thrashed the starter. His mind caressing the Tommy gun. Whispering in its ear. Already raking the train with hot metal.

"
Noshunse's door-slamming ploy had been fruitful. Almost too much so. He hadn't had the grace to both slam the door ahead and kick the one behind at the same time. Did he let go of the plan and try something else? No, of course not. He kicked like a mule, hanging from the third-class door by one hand. The kicked door's glass was unsound. The sound it made crashing to the floor was perfect. It got attention.

Noshunse would have been right pleased with himself, but for the fact that he was airborne. He fell off the grating over the couple. Reached up instinctively and caught the iron railing. A painful wrench. His left knee tangled in one of the two loose tow chains linking the cars. Had it not caught, his legs would have gone under. Instead, he heaved himself back up. Just in time to see Haani forty feet down the car charging forward.

Haani, seeing Noshunse's head appear, pulled up abruptly. Noshunse decided to play a little game. Back through the broken door making a show of dusting himself off carelessly.

"Sorry, pardon me, lads. Rum go! No harm done.

Noshunse looked up. Saw an old friend coming his way. Big smile, arms up, open.

"Barakat! Barakat Ahmad, man! What are you doing here? Did you see what I just did? I'm such a bloody idiot!

They closed the distance. Noshunse, not entirely steady. Happy to see a friend in every fiber of a being that appeared to have recently had at least a pint. Haani, unsure, slowing. Stuttering in Egyptian Arabic.

"That's not me. I am not that man. Who are you?

Noshunse put his right hand out in the Englishman's culturally inappropriate handshake of welcome. Still babbling in surprise to find his old friend heading to Alexandria. Haani was a canny operator. He didn't leave himself wide open. Nevertheless, the southpaw brass kiss rang his bell on round one.

Round two started with Noshunse again wildly off balance. Haani had a stabbing knife in his wrong hand. He got the tip into Noshunse's deltoid. It was not a clean cut. Haani was outweighed a bit and on the wrong side of gravity and momentum. Noshunse's frame clobbered him. They went down between seats. Haani's head hit the iron upright.

Noshunse's head rammed into a seat. He landed softer and bounced back faster. A softball right to the side of Haani's head bought him enough milliseconds to shift right, wind up his left leg, and punch it down. Noshunse had meant to snap Haani's tibia. For reasons of poor execution, he only damaged Haani's ankle.

Even as his ankle suffered, Haani shot out one of the left-side windows. It shattered into a cloud of golden insects and desert sand. An infant was screaming. After the roar, Noshunse couldn't hear it or anything else. He jammed a finger knocking the gun away.

In return, Haani gave Noshunse a shank to the right hand. Noshunse hollered exactly like a man who has been knifed in the hand. His brassed left snapped into Haani's face reflexively. Given the metal, it was lucky for Haani the damage wasn't worse. Either way, their fight was over.

The battle, however, was just getting started.

"
As all this was happening, Sadiki and Ibrâhîm were preparing to do some serious killing. Sadiki had waltzed into first-class. The passengers were mostly asleep. They dreamed in the warm and gentle breezes of the available to only those with sterling to spare. Sadiki did not envy them. They would be dead soon.

Reaching the baggage nook, Sadiki dropped his briefcase and got busy with the detonators. They punched into the tubes' paper ends. Safety fuses cut to ninety seconds. Ninety feet down the train Ibrâhîm was doing the same at the front of second class. His fuses were cut closer to sixty seconds.

The choreography called for Ibrâhîm and Sadiki to quickly assemble the explosives. When Ibrâhîm saw Sadiki was done in the next car he would light his fuses. They would hurry down to Selmi to disengage the clutch. In a perfect world, Selmi would see them coming and be ready. And in a paradisical world, Haani, seeing that the cars were disconnected, would apply the brakes to slow the disengaged cars.

As it played out, it dawned on all four freedom fighters that they did not live in the best of all possible worlds. Their unexpected dance partner was cut, bruised, pissed off, and had brought a demented Egyptian in a jeep, armed to the teeth, and dying to start blowing shit up himself. In a cartoon, it might been great fun. As it was, someone was going to get badly hurt. Collectively, they had ninety seconds to figure it all out.

"
As Noshunse hurried through the commotion, Selmi stepped back, not eager to be noticed. Now Noshunse had yet another dangerous man behind him. Unfortunately for Selmi, he back-trod on his wizened seatmate's right foot. Her pensioner's shoes were not sufficient protection. She squawked and gasped.

The old woman whipped a sizable pin from somewhere in the folds of her |milaya lef| and give him an attention getting jab. Whipping around Selmi slapped the old woman with an open-handed blow that made her bridge pop out. The noise was a sharp cracking thud above the wheels. Everything paused as if the hit stopped the seconds hand cold.

Then pandemonium. Four men put hands on the villain. Selmi went down. He was kicked. Hands on his shoulders. A hand pulled his hair. Selmi's forehead bounced off an iron bench.

Then he struggled to his feet. Ripped his arm free of his fellow passengers. Finding his gun still in his hand, he flipped the safety off and fired into the ceiling of the coach. Selmi's gun was a Spanish M1911 .45 caliber. Not a lightweight. The ceiling buckled and ripped outward. Cordite and tinnitus. Everyone hit the floor.

In the middle of second-class Noshunse heard the shot distantly. His ears were still ringing from the discharge of Haani's firearm. He kept moving. Ahead was a calamity in the offing. At the baggage partition before the vestibule leading to first class, he saw Ibrâhîm's back foot. Noshunse hauled him from behind the curtain. Ibrâhîm crashed across the aisle and staggered into the first row.

Noshunse kicked bags aside and saw dynamite tubes. He grabbed a heavy suitcase and cartwheeled it in a two-hundred-and-eighty-degree haymaker at the window. The glass smashed into the wind. The bag flew out the window. Off balance, Noshunse almost went with it as Ibrâhîm landed an kick square on his back. Noshunse staggered. His left hand caught the sill. Glass shards ripped into his palm. His forehead bounced off the frame. Ibrâhîm followed up with a downward-slicing elbow.

Had Ibrâhîm led with his knife, not his foot, it might have gone badly for the Major. Noshunse spun into a baggage rack, caught himself, reversed, and just avoided Ibrâhîm's slashing follow-up. They rolled sloppily back into the aisle and broke apart. There was yelling at the back of the car. Noshunse was first on his feet and looked behind him. An Egyptian lad was waving a hand cannon at him from sixty feet away.

Noshunse spun to the right to present a smaller target, kneed Ibrâhîm flat, and drew his firearm in a single motion. He fired first. His main concern was not hitting anyone in front or behind Selmi. Actually hitting Selmi was secondary to brushing him back. Three quick shots later Selmi was back in the interstage, aiming from the corner of the doorway. Selmi's challenge was to kill Noshunse without damaging Ibrâhîm or, rapidly coming down train behind them, Sadiki. He was not being reckless. He knew what Sadiki had just set in motion. It was time to kill this imperial thug quickly, light Ibrâhîm's fuses, and get the hell off the train. He fired again and again.

"
Rippling canals mirrored the deep blue sky. Bright songbirds sang homely |felláheen| paeans of domestic joy. Insects with diaphanous wings refracted the light of Ra into microscopic fountains of color. The breeze paused from chasing coy dawn across Abu Qir Bay. The tracks stretched, snapped, and thrummed in the languid heat. They sparkled with sunbeams where the steel was ground fine as cut glass.

Eight feet above, less benign tracks of fire spit from large-caliber steel pistol barrels. Gunsmoke expanded and curled in the train's forty-two-mile-per-hour wake. Sparks flashed. Train windows fractured into the canals.

About a hundred yards west of the rolling gun battle Har was delirious with sweaty-handed glee. Steering with his knees. Muzzle flares reflected off the broken glass. Har's teeth ground furiously. He fumbled for the Thompson. Har had already disengaged the safety, proving to himself he wasn't a complete imbecile. Damned if he couldn't operate a Tommy gun one-handed at fifty-three miles-per-hour.

Har's first trigger pull blew out the Morris's rear right window. The next pull ripped three windows out of the train's world. The Morris janked and pulled. Har stood on the gas then braked, yanked the clutch, and near pulled the trigger with the gun pointed at the floor. Dangerously intoxicating behavior pounded through his veins. The train took another lashing from the Tommy gun. Har couldn't stop laughing.

"
Noshunse, realizing Sadiki was behind him, yanked Ibrâhîm to his feet from behind. He pressed back to the wall across from the baggage alcove. Gun at Ibrâhîm's head. Sadiki got the message and moved down car, towards Selmi. His eyes and gun never left Noshunse.

Noshunse circled and back away towards first-class. Now he faced three insurgents, unlit explosives, and seventy feet of prone passengers with glass in their hair. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the Morris bumping and spitting fire. Haani fired back. The distraction was helpful. But Noshunse had a problem: what had Sadiki been doing in first class? He thought he knew. He didn't like the thought.

Noshunse knifed Ibrâhîm in the right arm with his own pikal to make him less of a threat. Then he near threw the Nationalist down the aisle at his comrade. Selmi and Sadiki opened up over the benches. Noshunse leapt for the door, jumped the gap, and ran up the carriage. Bullets kept coming. Luckily, motion and the wild gun car kept the insurgents off balance.

Noshunse briskly clobbered a Brit firing a gentleman's roscoe at the Morris. He misunderstood what flag the vehicle was flying. At the baggage area, as expected, more dynamite. Lit. He chucked the tubes out the first shattered window. Optimistically, that took care of that car. He headed back towards the gunmen, his gun firing.

Har now took several serious risks. By rights, they shouldn't have worked even well enough to lie about. The road had flattened out, then dipped. Har got neck and neck with the locomotive and was gaining. The road was angling closer to the tracks. Soon the bridge and the desert. He floored it while fumbling for the box of grenades.

On the train and behind it fuses were hissing. A knot of explosives lay on the embankment. Noshunse knew he had to get back to the second-class coach's baggage area and clear it. But now he faced three pistols barking and snapping. The cars were still coupled. The uncoupling part of the gang's plan hadn't gone well either. Really, though, what part of the plan |had| gone well?

And then, in the middle of the desperate firefight, the insurgents took a |coup de grâce|: close air support. It came in the compact form of two Mills bombs. They were inexplicably well-aimed. Har had pulled into a wild spin that left the Morris facing back towards Cairo. His door was open before the slide stopped. The first grenade was in the air before the second-class transom was level to him. The second bomb came flying right after.

The Mills grenade is a fragmentary blast with a one-hundred-foot damage radius. The first one shredded Selmi. Over one hundred steel shards penetrated as much as four inches into the thicker parts of him. Thinner parts were sheared clean off. The second car's vestibule's overhanging roof of metal and wood essentially snapped off. It avalanched down on the remains of Selmi and into the doorway. The second grenade pealed three large panels off the third car. All the surviving windows were now gone.

Noshunse sensed the clock running out. Shocking proof of that came in the form of a massive explosion from behind the train. Megajoules get attention. In the baggage area, he found the remaining tubes, hurtled them at the window. One bounced off the frame. He grabbed it. Staggered, tripping on suitcases. Off balance. More glass bit already lacerated hands. He fell half out throwing the package as hard as he could. It flew more back than out.

Ibrâhîm was on the floor in a bloody heap. Sadiki was in a dream. Lacerations and bleeding ears. He was tattooed with steel fragments, glass powder, and pine splinters. Sadiki saw tubes of explosives sailing out the window. He saw the first one explode. Too late, his eyes screwed down, his arms flew up, and his head snapped around. Dizzy from too many concussions. Inner ears in catastrophic shutdown.

The final four-megajoule block arrived wobbling through the slipstream not eight feet from the battered wall of the carriage. Level with Sadiki's waist. It flashed. A burning celluloid image of a ruined train painted the insides of his eyes.

Sadiki was thrown clear through the shattered remains. He landed very hard.

It was only seven-thirty a.m.

Back in Cairo, in a spartan but colorful canal-side room, a young woman dreamt. Black-henna wedjat eyes on delicate hands, a sweet smile on her lips. She was dreaming of her goofily exuberant new boyfriend. A charming young man by the name of Har. Her dream had left him waving his fists in triumph, dancing a crazed dance on a dirt road that smelled like an artillery bombardment.

Har had offered her a means to an end. Her vengeance using him as her instrument. The taste of cartoonish violence was sweet. More such was definitely in her future. Of that she was sure. First, it was time for breakfast. She opened her crocodilian eyes. All forty-eight of them. They observed her like death and she smiled right back.

The woman known to Har as Shanameena used many names. Once she had been just Sisi. Sisi was already having a very good day.

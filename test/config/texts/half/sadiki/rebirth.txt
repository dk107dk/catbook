>1951 - Sadiki revivifies in Cairo

Two hundred kilometers from Abu Qir Bay, where Noshunse looked forward to a crash landing, Ani Sadiki had long lived in a cement box on a narrow alley. It was neither better nor worse than any other sweating alley populated by dogs, goats, and men with cuts on their hands.

In the days before the bomber came down, Sadiki had taken fever. He was done sleeping at midday. Done with the drift into |loukmet el-qadi| and |goulash| and away from real food. His belt had expanded. His pistols rusted on hooks. It was not good, he had thought. It could not continue, he was sure. The Sobek icon's blink was an unmistakable sign. But how to spin up new-found angst into a younger Sadiki's angry energy? The effort quickly became a manic work in motion.

Sadiki habitually leaned contemplative and methodical. And yet he had had his fill of that. Too little hard-set jaw and dagger-looks. Palm strikes and balls of feet. He had become meek. It was infuriating to wake one day and remember himself, as he had been. Now, what was left? His front hall was broken boots and catnip balls. His books were French.

All the things the world had taken. The hearing in his right ear. The smooth flexing of unhesitant legs. The sharpness of thought and words that had made him magnetic. His briefly-won fortune, not least. And at the fore, his father's love. All that, and now to waken one day to the realization: the loss of his love for his striving vengeance after so much striving had repeatedly collapsed. Once he had thought he might tear even a small hole in the veil of history suffocating his country. Never had it mattered what the balance arm showed. Only that he weigh his heart against the heavy breath of Sobek, not the golden feathers of |Ma Ωat|.

He had grown old. He had grown so old. It was unacceptable!

|Old friend and cousin. The Eye of the Prow Rope yet moves! Hurry to me above the shops. Bring who you can, and a honeycomb with all its angry bees awake and buzzing.

Hanni had faired no different. Their organization had fallen to petty crime and the gray market. They sold mercenarial expertise in arts not black enough for notoriety, yet plenty dark for coin. It kept the men going in a marginal waiting existence. A pause in his and Hanni's lifelong journey. The kind of pause that could lead to a casual death by falling down the apartment block's narrow stairs. Or to outliving one's dwindling family and usefulness.

This much he knew: in that year the land was dark with hatred. His fellows had infernal talents going to waste. The liquidation short of his four floors of crumbling mediocrity would buy much violence. And he sensed he had a few days at most. Sell what deadened the soul, buy what killed the British. Strengthen his leaden limbs, gather his old friends, and get the hell out of Cairo, north. A contest was coming.

If it was to be his last, let the sunset explode crimson and gold.

>1929 - Georges Juan Marat's journal

"The volume I have been describing these past few pages is confirmed. I have corroborated virtually everything to the statements of other parties. Far from fact. Nevertheless, something.

"The "Tempora Mutatori" apparently emerged in the West Midlands of Great Britain. It could have been Copenhagen, Wien, Hamburg, or any other centre of the arts and industry. The author speculates that similar societies did in fact arise, but did not take.

"The writer felt the so-called Knights Temporal were uniquely endemic to County Palatine of Chester. In sum, due to a convergence: sophisticated craftsmen, elevated citizenry, and accumulated wealth. These, in the absence of intramural wars: trades versus gentry, town versus gown, priests versus aristocracy. And perhaps most important: watchmaking was greatly decoupled from stargazing.

"In short, a rich stew, well mixed.

"In London, the crafts fought tooth and nail. In Paris, blood flowed too frequently in the gutters. In Geneva, the stars were indentured to militant timekeepers. In Cambridge Massachusetts, the single-minded watchmakers were mechanical philistines.

"Manchester, by contrast, was simple. Wealthy dilettantes constructed telescopes using whatever philosophical instrument artisan, clockwork movement maker, or optician was available. Professional proprietaries were muted. There were no time observatories and no institutes horlogerie. It was a quiet free-for-all.

"Eventually some dilettante was going to look up and wonder. What would happen under an extreme objective? What if light collected like snow on a mirror? What lay behind the deepest blackness? One individual is all it might take. And in Manchester, a little time dilation might be overlooked as merely in poor taste.

"I jest. I should not.

"Moreover, the same ingredients that kept time-benders from enraging timekeepers made more likely the inverse. Manchester had no optician-against-watchmaker wars and no organized scientific instruments trade. A watchmaker would be free to plunge into abstract microscopy.

"An ungroomed savant goes blank in mid-sentence, recovers, delivers the impossible solution, and yet cannot remember the question asked. Another watchmaker starves to death working at his bench. In Manchester, who would look twice?

"In this milieu, where dilettantes meet derelicts, sooner or later one would recognize the other. One plus one would make zero. There would be balance. A closed society of secrets would naturally arise. A cabal of those who look up linking arms with those who look down. The one straining to hang on to the present. The other struggling just to reach it.

"It had to happen somewhere. Why not Manchester?

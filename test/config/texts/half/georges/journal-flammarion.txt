>1929 - Georges Juan Marat's journal

"Lebre's young nephew Mille lent me a most unusual book yesterday. Lumen. It is by the famous astronomer Camille Flammarion.

"I was immediately taken aback. It is shockingly on the mark. Yet Byzantine and rambling. I can take no more than a paragraph or two at a time. Many years ago Flammarion may have seen precisely what I see.

|The notion of time is essentially relative. There is nothing real or absolute in the measure of duration. Having once left the Earth, I had lost all standard of measure, and I said to myself that years, centuries indeed, might have passed over my head without my perceiving it, and that the time had seemed short to me because of the great interest I had taken in my aerial voyage...

"Is it really a work of fiction? Or maybe a fevered retelling of reality?

"Sadly, Flammarion died four years ago in seclusion at his private observatory at Juvisy-sur-Orge. They say he had gone mad.

|Paris had grown old and had suffered transformations since my departure from the Earth — an interval of time absolutely unknown to me. It was so much easier to think that I beheld the city of the future. I continued my observations carefully, in order to ascertain if it was really the old Paris, now partly demolished, or if, by a phenomenon still more incredible, it was another Paris, another France, another world.

"Oh, to speak with that madman! What stories we could have told each other.

"I must go to the observatory. Camille's widow, Gabrielle Flammarion, watches there still. She must know what fever took him to write such. Is she likewise beset by les Défenseurs? Surely she will give some indication. I have no doubt she can explain much.

>1929 - Georges Juan Marat's journal, last entry

"Tonight I leave the Observatory and my home. I doubt I will return.

"Danica will not come. She does not listen. I may be hunted down. Maybe her staying is for the best?

"I hear sounds at the window and door. When I look, nothing.

"Tonight I become someone new: Jacques de Saulcy. Styled after a friend of the family when I was young. It sounds familiar but not notable. I can inveigle traveling papers for Jacques through connections.

"Tonight our bricoleur will drive me to Morteau. A quiet friend, Lebre Carpentier, has arranged a riverboat. From Doubs to the Saône, the Rhône, and thence Marseille and to Sea. I will find an anonymous passage. There are places secrets go. Alexandria. Perhaps the great Libyan Desert. Somewhere I can live without fear of the mystery of time.

"I'm afraid to go into the night. I fear staying far more. And I'm afraid of what may happen to Danica if she stays. But what can I do. Lebre will watch her discreetly.

"I am done with this. May whoever succeeds me find these words. Perhaps a help, not something abhorrent.

>1951 - Half, Sisi, Saeed, and Louis parley in Alexandria

There is a world out there somewhere where unusual things happen. Inexplicable things. Things you can barely imagine. Some of those things are permitted by the laws of physics. Some are accepted by common sense. Some things are, of course, not. And a few of those things happened in Alexandria.

It is of the essence of worlds to overlap. Of passions to erupt. Historic injustice and personal tragedy both to obtain. The more the involved parties are aggrieved, the more intensely imagined the scene. The more intensively imagined, the more deeply felt. The more so felt, the more perceived as real. And the more a thing is made to feel real, the more history bends to it in submission.

Presently, Ktt Hathor Mutneferet, Sisi, Saeed Amir Sadiki, and Louis Jules Gruey arrived separately at the headlands of Anfouchi Bay, of late occupied by Fort Adda. To one side, the bombed-out ruins of Alexandria Harbor. To the other, thousands of dead Frenchmen, Brits, and Turks charred on the turning spit of Egypt known as Aboukir. None of the four promenaders were dainty. They walked around a pile of ripe corpses at the peak of the ruins, the sacrificed members of Saeed's one hundred.

As these four mounted the hill, knots of angry |felláheen| and the working poor gathered in the streets below. The shirtless, barefoot Egyptians assembled with meat cleavers, crowbars, stout hoes, and sharpened shovels. They lit truck tires in the road as the boys filled dirty Egypt Cola bottles with clean Shell gasoline. The streets were shadowed, voices dark, faces grim.

Gradually the four arrivals stood in a silent row staring out to sea. Then they turned to face each other. Each took one side of a ruined twenty-pounder. Their eyes looked steadily and with position. The murdered, the casualty, the kidnapped, and the child orphaned. They wondered who should speak first.

It turned out that was Sisi.

"Sir, I presume you are the elder Sadiki.

Sadiki looked at her intently.

"Indeed, I am that man.

Sisi, hands on hips, stared balefully. Half, to that point transfixed by the long-lost sight of Sisi, turned to observe the effect on Sadiki.

"Mesdames et Monsieur, if I may ask one of you to explain this.

Gruey waved vaguely in a way that managed to take in all of the ruined city, the cannoneer corpses, and the smoldering fields of Aboukir. As the only true French citizen, apparently, he felt attention and explanation his due. The Egyptians thought otherwise and ignored him. Their voices had been becoming increasingly sharp.

"You have taken liberties with my son's life. It is not possible that I look away. It is of honor.

Sadiki, strident, had found himself cornered by the women.

"You have children, and yet you suffer your child to inflict on others what you would not yourself accept.

Half spat. Her spit scattered flies from a dead Egyptian soldier.

"What do you know of what I accept and what I do not?!

Sadiki drew himself up. Not a tall man. He nevertheless never failed to give the impression of height. Backed to a parapet, he mounted an eighty-kilogram fragment of sandstone ashlar and gestured horizon to horizon.

"This is my country! Look at it! Burning! My land is in ruins! I accept none of this!

Sisi had a rock in her right fist. She was swinging it towards Sadiki's head.

"Look at me!

Half's voice was low. Its edge, dangerous. The wind and the waves halted to hear her. Sisi's violent motion slowed precipitously. The world abruptly slammed into a dead pause.

"Your country? Yours? This land is not empty. We are right here.

As she spoke, Gruey found his voice. He ducked around the frozen Sisi in mid-swing. He moved between the three. Sadiki's face was a plaster cast of taken aback. Gruey stepped past him to adjoin Half. He took her hand graciously.

"Enchantée.

Half coolly explored his broad, unfamiliar Norman face. He felt the hot morning sun. He was not frozen.

"These two. They are, comment dit-on? They are the irresistible one and the immovable one, non? And are they happy, thuswise? I wonder.

He frowned clinically.

"It is good you give them a pause for breath.

Half's eyes followed him. He stepped up to the calcified gun carriage between them. He thrust his hands into the sticky black blood-crusted tangle of hair of its last gunner.

"He did not surrender his gun. Nor can he fire it.

Half stepped closer to death and the Frenchman. Sisi and Sadiki remained immotile.

"Where did his killer die? We don't know. Who was he? Who can say?

Half murmured a response. Gruey assumed she spoke Egyptian Arabic, which he did not. He paused in case a respectful pause was required. Then, with a grand gesture, he continued.

"Nous sommes aussi comme ça. We are able, in certain moments – too rarely, in my experience, but parfois – we can have a positive influence. Together a balance. A balancing of the stars, the sun, the moon, and this overcrowded island in space. Our tiny planet, without which even time itself has no meaning.

He paused mid-soliloquy as if at a surprising thought.

"Without all these humans there to observe it, they wouldn't call it time.

Half arched an eyebrow. Gruey's eyes crinkled in self-mockery.

"Who is this they? Well, précisément!

He warmed to his summation.

"My dear, after all, it comes down to just this. You and me. In sharp relief against the sweeping grandeur of all human affairs reduced to the atomic concept of time. We are the rulers of all things.

Half looked at Gruey. She smiled a slight smile of the utmost subtlety.

"I accept. If you, sir, will let the past go, I will, in turn, let the present arrive.

Gruey nodded gravely. He reached out to the static Sadiki. As he did, he maintained one hand on the dead gunner's head. The wind recovered its poise. It blew away the dust of Egyptians and Frenchmen alike.

The waves once again rushed the shore. The sun peered again through the smoke at a modern Egyptian metropolis. One contemplating the recapitulation of its violent past. Time spun up a present deeply unsettled.

Just before Half woke she saw Sisi reanimate, turn to her, nod, and drop the rock from her fist.

"I understand, my sister. Of course I will help you.

And then, at exactly the right moment, Half opened her eyes.

"It has to be now.

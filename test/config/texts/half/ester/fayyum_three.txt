>1928 - Half escapes the Fayyum, Egypt

At the end of Half's first season at the temple, Soki sprang something new on her.

"Hathor, soon you will perform a self-dedication ritual. You will become a supplicant of Sobek. It is an honor not available to others.

Half resisted the urge to betray emotion. Soki continued.

"In the ceremony, you will bind yourself to a manifestation of Sobek for protection from malevolence. In turn, you must offer something to him. This is where your craftsmanship will be celebrated and ordained. You and I will decide an offering you can commit to.

A manifestation. Right. It was an offer Half was powerless to resist. She had, in any case, already decided to do whatever she was asked. Her hope was to help her missing mom, Amunet, wherever she was, by playing up acquiescence and feigning belief. Being a successful "supplicant" was mainly a question of Half not forgetting herself and lashing out.

The ancient ceremony was simple. Priests placed a brightly glazed fourteen-foot crocodile mummy on the altar. Incense burned. Incantations in an unintelligible pre-Coptic language. Murmured responses. Kneeling, standing, kneeling, standing.

Then an unsettling moment punctuated the long ceremony. Without a signal, Sisi was led into the sacristy. Dressed in bleached linens, pressed to sharp edges. Little face whitened with powder. Sisi didn't look across the room to Half. To Half, her eyes looked unfocused. Why? Half wanted to cry out.

After inseparable weeks on the road, when they first arrived at the temple Half and Sisi had soon been separated. Their separation had lasted only a few days. Half suspected the fellows had been testing them. The evening Sisi was returned to her they huddled in their chilly cell. They drew |mehndi| on their hands with candle ash. Hummed quiet harmonics that laid claim to the small space. Fell asleep against the wall, heads curled into one another.

Over many months, Half and Sisi, treated as sisters, were by circumstances and by assignments slowly weened. Half missed the few chances they had to be alone. She missed Sisi's delicate hands. Her soft Duchenne smiles. The smell of her hair. And the lullabies she sang to help Half slip into an often disquieting sleep.

The ceremony closed with odd legalistic formality. Half was well-nigh compelled to sign a document. The papyrus was short. It obliged her to create eyes of Sobek, learn from the physicians, and in turn teach them to make stone that lived. Sisi was identified as Half's handmaiden and dependent. Sisi's name stood out in red script in several places.

Half's thoughts summed up to:

"Yeah, whatever.

Once Half signed, Sisi was immediately hauled away as callous fingers dug into Half's shoulder. The import was abundantly clear. The paper itself changed nothing. Yet the ceremony confirmed everything. The eye-maker was both gilded and chained. That night Half cried herself to sleep for the first time in months, alone.

So, she taught the physicians and learned from them. She carved what was asked. And late in the evenings in her workshop's inner room she taught herself. Each artifact Half constructed was more incredible. She far outstripped what she showed the dull physicians during the day.

Her works were intrinsically driven by intimate fears and inhibitions she was eager to excise and loath to share. Nevertheless, at the end of the month, reluctantly, Half handed over her "offerings". For Sisi. For Amunet. And to buy herself a degree of freedom within her limestone cage.

"
Over the months, among many other new skills, Half learned glass. In her village she had occasionally scavenged fragments. At |Qasr Qaroun| scavenging was out of the question. She had only to show an interest for the fellows to immediately cater to it. Molten glass was new. She was fascinated.

Half was introduced to a glassblower named Bahri. Bahri was an elder artificer. She was there to draw glass forms for the physicians. Half learned eagerly from her. Bahri treated Half as the young artist she wanted to be. Albeit, one with a monomania. They turned hard materials into microscopic structures that flowed, pulsed, and tangled. They crafted glass tissues, tubules, sleeves, and threads so fine they flexed. Often Bahri joined Half in her workshop. She brought Half new tools and materials. They built a hearth.

Half's eyes became even more lifelike. They came to have structure inside, motion outside. Lids dipped. Pupils floated. Shivering nerve bundles from spun glass tendrils. Cords that branched, splayed, and snaked with the minute chaos of living tissue. Within her apparently solid eyes Half hid biotic complexity. Why did that matter? Embedding latent artilect was simple agency. Bahri was amused and fascinated. She understood Half's urge.

"Swnwt, you marvelous, devious child. What is hidden is unknowable. How do you know what this eye sees once you close its shell? You may create little monsters.

Half didn't know if she was merely kidding, or not. It wasn't hidden that Half's skills were deemed important. The eyes were her principle work. Half found it hard to not talk about her crazy visions. She found it equally hard to say a thing. Even to Bahri, who seemed likely to have her own crazy story to tell. Half settled for quiet camaraderie.

For two years she was afraid her friend would be yanked away. Like everything else.

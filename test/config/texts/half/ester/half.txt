>1907 - Half grows up near Luxor, Egypt

Two years since the last rain, as the middle Nile heat baked the topsoil to powder, about five hundred miles upstream of Alexandria, Ktt Hathor Mutneferet was born.

Ktt Hathor's parents named her after the ancient Egyptian gods. Her unusual names sounded good to their modern ears. Why she was named as she was, she was never told. No doubt the reason was important. That is deep in most cultures and usually the case.

Be that as it may, misfortune spoke. Ktt Hathor's father, Sakir Wazad Ahmet, a successful village blacksmith, drove off the aqueduct way avoiding a bedouin's goat, lost control, accelerated down a sandy scree, and crashed his cart into old Mat's |sakieh|. Flung out, he cracked his head on the impoundment. An iron bar shot through the front of the cart and pierced his lung. Three days later he died in a fever. Ktt Hathor's mother, Amunet, was heartbroken. Her daughter was five.

Years later, in Manchester, England, Ktt Hathor became known as Ester de Saulcy, the grandmother of Saharalee and Anakoni. That name came much later.

Children of the lane simply called her Half. She liked the sound. In the village, children were called many names. None stuck to Half. Amunet ignored most of the village. By Half’s pre-teens, her mother had taken extra work keeping house for an unmarried Frenchman. In time, he became like a stepfather to Half. He used her actual name, Hathor, with a strong French accent. He was the only one who did.

The man was a healer, a |sheykh|, of a modern school. Despite his modernity, the Frenchman was deeply bound to the sand and dry wind. Why so, he felt uncompelled to explain. He was the second great-grandson of Clot Bey, Napoleon's medical emissary to Pasha Muhammad Ali al-Mas'ud ibn Agha, commander in Cairo, magnate of the waters south to the Sudan. Scarred and stony, though gracious. The kind of European that stood out vividly among his own. One that was quietly served first at his infrequent appearances in the village |ahwa|. Antoine Saint-Pierre Clot didn't take the pipe.

Half and Amunet lived a few miles outside Karnak, south of Luxor, called Thebes by the French, among other names, and |Waset| by Anton, once he became their |m'unfu|, their protector. Their village had a functional name that translated loosely from Egyptian Arabic as Reed Boatworks.

Reed was a Nile backwater sheltered by |Jazirat al Bayadiyah| island, where the marshes are shielded from the seasons' surges. It was quiet. The stamp and swish of food animals and the sibilance of insect wings. With Amunet working three jobs, their house was most often half empty. Still, Half became happy.

Amunet was a lapidarist, an independent artisan of |m'ntatá|. According to Anton, in the old tongue she was a |sejem ash|. Her craft was making polished semi-precious stones, |shawabti| figurines of stonepaste for traditional funerals, name seals, and carved glass for celebrations. Her work was good.

Half was her skilled helper and unpaid labor. Even at six, Half found the most friable feldspar, and quartz outcrops. The tumble-friendly desert stones with flecks of fluorite, malachite, and other colors. On her best days, Half might even spot tiny fragments of Turquoise to add to the skin purse around her neck. Half's work was also good.

When Half was two, Amunet had crafted rattles and roller toys for her filled with small stones and sand. From her crib to her full height, Half played with them. As she grew older, she played more purposefully. Eventually, it wasn't play. Constant unconscious but volitional movement. There was rarely a time when the house didn't have rustling thrumbling rhythms. Rocks slowly ground down to their beautiful essence. Earth polished into money.

Half lived in the river and by the river. The rocks she found on the rocky plains were dislodged by the river. Parched washes veined the highland. Fish and reptiles lurked below. Food came upriver on barges. Luxor transshipped their bags of stones downriver. The river plied the steep banks till the palms fell drunk in the shallows. It grew reeds more quickly than they could be harvested, dried, and woven. River water was hand-pumped by Amunet and Half into trays of flowers. Their arrangements sold well on feast days. The water was free. The profits were meager.

When Half was seven, Amunet sang to her as she worked. Half hummed along. Both kept busy. Amunet invented mechanisms to keep Half engaged and lighten the work. She saw every scrap of potential energy. The water that dripped from the growing tables. The fig strings that swayed from the crossbeams. The washing tub and pestle. The market cart. The donkey and the goats. Some of these things could be taught to tumble rocks. Amunet challenged Half to think of ways.

When Half turned ten Amunet traded twenty ceramic amulets for a child's bicycle. Rusted and bent. Fixable. Powerful. Half taught herself in the baked lane mud. Gaining confidence, she tried things. One thing was ill-conceived: peddling down the escarpment. She kicked up gravel and was distracted by it – small stones were distracting. Half catapulted over the rocky bank into the muddy flow.

Three days later the bruises were yellowed. She had the wheels off. The frame on a block. A light barrel attached to the axle with string and pegs. The barrel spun. Rocks clattered. Half and Amunet sang louder. The contraption, original purpose unfulfilled, paid for itself rapidly and with less exertion.

At twelve, with surprisingly little assistance, Half invented another device to grind rocks. She mounted a solid frame in the river. Old Mat helped her saw and drill. She traded polished stones for hinges. Half nailed lengths of wood to the hinges. Nailed hinges to every other stave of a sizable barrel – paddles. Her former bike's front wheel's hub held one side. Another hub found at the dumping ground supported the other. Once the apparatus was coaxed into motion, Half could tumble ten pounds of rock even while sleeping. Increasingly, Amunet left polishing and carving stone to Half.

Arriving in the village, Anton took a modest shop with a room above. There he took temperatures, set bones, and doled out palliatives. Extracts, aspirin, and traditional remedies. He used what tools became available from traders working the villages.

On her way from riverside to market, Amunet frequently cut through the lane where Anton's shop was. She unrolled a mat among the stalls. Figurines, stones, glass. Anton passed by occasionally, quietly, basket in hand. Wheat, eggs, goat.

One day Anton stopped abruptly. He inspected a figurine of Osiris. Red atef with milky green skin. His pocked and parched face wore gray bristles. She, black |gallebaya| and shawl. Their voices were quiet. Eyes slightly averted.

"You have skill.

Amunet said nothing. This was new.

"Your child will need to see me one day. Would you care to labor a little against that time? I will pay well.

Amunet said nothing.

"I am no housekeeper. If you wanted to. Care for my professional rooms two or three afternoons every decan. Morning or evening. You could offer your charms to my patients. When you are in need, I would attend to you and Hathor.

Amunet drew a shallow breath. How did he know her? Who told this strange-sounding |khawaga| her Half was named for the Goddess of the Sky?

"Good sir. I will call on you tomorrow to discuss if I may assist you. You will be available at what hour in the morning?

Amunet swept and scrubbed the whitewashed storefront on the way to the market, or the way back. She left carved glass beads and scarabs in the window. Some sold. Anton collected her money dutifully. The front room was clean and spare. In time, Amunet decorated it with rugs, hangings, and low chairs. Ultimately the small but predictable income saved her time for more production. Half and Amunet used time well.

One day, Anton presented Amunet with several reeds growing in muddy soil held in a square clay container embossed with a crocodile. The reed was Cyperus papyrus, Anton said. Asked where it came from he said only, far south. Amunet recognized papyrus from drawings on walls in Karnak and Deir el-Medina. Anton helped them plant it in the black soil behind their compound by the river. It grew well.

At first, Half did not visit Anton's clinic. She busied herself prospecting, preparing stones, and finishing them. Along with this work, she found time to construct machines of abrasion. Her skill as a tinkerer grew rapidly.

Half's father’s workshop had taken up the front of the family compound. Their small house was built behind it. After years of fooling with the hand tools and assorted metal pieces left to her, Half had everything neatly sorted in boxes. Billows, anvil, vise, press, pulleys, and grinding wheels packed in quenching tubs. They stockaded the front windows.

Half was no blacksmith. A more practical family might have sold the tools. She and Amunet were not sentimental. The tools were the means to create. Half was rich of imagination. Given the arid life of an artisan widow and child, she was motivated to invent.

And then came an evening when Amunet arrived home late with a project. She had been at the market. It had been a good day. She had done chores at the clinic on an empty stomach. Walking in, she dropped her scarf and pulled an object from her |gallebaya|. It was bright silver. A delicate hammer with a white object at its head. An American-made tomahawk reflex hammer. Perhaps the finest manufacture Half had ever seen. It was broken.

"It is for striking the knee to see it jerk. At-tabib uses it to know if a fellah is ready for the fields after an injury. Come, feel this top piece.

Half reached for the hammer. The percussion piece was made of a milky substance. Hard and soft at once. The piece was loose in its fitting. It had melted and burned. The handle was carbonized at the loop that held the hammer's head. Striated and roughened for grip. The word |Taylor| was engraved. Was a tailor was a maker of clothes? Perhaps |at-tabib| was a tailor?

The hammer was designed with purpose. Balance. Precision. Half was transfixed. She wanted to hit something with it. When she tapped the table the singular stone that was not stone popped off.

"At-tabib asked me if I could make a new headpiece. The same shape. He said it could be polished rock or ceramic. Something that cannot hurt the person tapped by it. What do you think? Do you have an idea?

Half asked what the head was made of.

"It is called plastek. It comes from far away. He didn't have more to show. We can keep the material, once we replace it.

Half's head was already considering the options. She imagined polished grooved stones. How to fix the head in place? Was the metal ductile? Was it steel? Could she flake and grind a headpiece that had the exact proportions?

With few obvious indications, Anton's influence headed them towards a future most villagers would not have chosen. His gift of novel work and unknown material was exciting. In time, Anton became close, like family. For Egypt, those were unsettled times. Unnamed |felláheen| slipped through villages like ominous shadows. It was good to have a protector.

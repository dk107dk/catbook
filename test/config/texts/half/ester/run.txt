They fled Reed Boatworks around two a.m. Half left first on the donkey heading south to where she had cached her skiff. Amunet donned a veil and walked quickly to Anton's clinic to take his bicycle. She would peddle to Luxor and catch a bus north. Anton took Amunet's horse. He would cross the canal and ride the Western Agricultural Road dressed as a |fellah|.

They would meet in Asyut at the mouth of the Ancient Canal. Amunet would arrive first after about ten hours on the road. Fellows would meet her. When Anton and Half caught up, they would hire a barge north to Shedet in the Fayyum. There, scholars would take them in.

They thought they needed seven days. Traveling north from Luxor in 1924 was usually straightforward. To those born to it, the land was quite passible. In the end, they were wrong. Nothing was straightforward and it took far longer.

"
Anton supped alone in the kitchen at the rear. Setting his fork down, he straightened and softly called Half's name.

"Ktt Hathor?

Half looked up through the clay beads from the next room where she worked. Eyes of Sobek-Horus in black traced her hands and arms. She wore a tunic embroidered with her own designs. Magnifying glass. Dry-point stylus. Half was no longer a child. She spoke less and her face give little away.

"I'm going for dates and bread. Tell your mother I'll return shortly.

The market. All their troubles seemingly began in the market, as such things do.

Half's eyes were magnetic. They stood out brazenly from other wares on Amunet's matt. As they sold, Half obsessively created more in ever finer detail. She inlaid semi-precious stones tumbled in the garden. Metallic tracery. Organic intaglio. Symbolic |sgraffito|. Lacquer. Tiny pores and pools. Vessels within veins channeling liquids. She poured in cerebrospinal angst generously.

A therapeutic obsession had become an unhealthy monomania. It drove Half's skill soaring. Soon her workmanship became so dramatic Amunet could charge rarities prices. Half's mirific eyes of Sobek found their way into galleries at Luxor and Cairo and to luxurious dahabeeyahs riding off the Elephantine. The side benefits of Half's monomania were not unwelcome.

As attention grew, Amunet and Half turned away from the village. While collectors talking amongst themselves was welcome, the villagers also talked. The village talk had lately taken a turn to the suspicious. The market grew cold.

"
Later that same evening Anton reentered the compound quickly from the front. He walked with a limp. That was new. He ushered in a tall man with city hands. Clothes cleaner. Cloth thicker. Not |fell√°heen|. Entering, the man carefully dismounted an oiled leather case and doffed his chechia. He removed thin wire glasses with a delicate tint.

Anton introduced him shortly as Fellow Sadiki. Sadiki gave a slight bow and appreciations. Amunet welcomed him. Offered |karkadeh| accepted. Half stood back. Shy to a well-dressed stranger unexpectedly appearing in her home. Curious, yet impatient to return to work before the lamps waned. Something urgent in the air held her.

Anton gestured into the sitting room.

"Fellow will be leaving the village tonight. That he esteems us with a visit ennobles this house.

The visitor spoke softly.

"The honor is entirely mine. To meet the maker of the living Eye of Horus-Sobek is a rare mystery unraveled. No distance is too great.

The light confirmed an Egyptian ancestry accented by two shadow scars on the right side of his face. One traced his cheekbone. The other his jaw. Combined, they gave him an angular visage, despite softening stubble. By his words and manners, Sadiki was a scholar. By his scars and bearing, considerably harder. He looked at Half with fixation and concern.

Anton had long hinted he had his own concerns. Amunet likewise. Half knew they worried. Half didn't leave the compound much in those days. When she did, though, murmurs tattled along the narrow streets. Hushed on hot breezes wafting through window and gauze. Rare visits to buildings hummed more than before. Villages are full of secrets. Everything settles crooked. Wild ideas crack through the fading colors of rough-cut doors.

Half had ignored it all. She cut through the |souk| crosswise. A visionary introverted |simoom| that left dust and debris. She had no time for interactions or accommodations. She didn't say |salaam aleikum| or excuse herself. Her reception was generally a little better than that of the municipal grain collector. It often wasn't reciprocated to even that.

Yet for all her inward focus, Half remained observant. Her senses were in no way dulled. She retained the ability to discern tiny flakes of turquoise in desert hill gravel while listening for the swish of Bedouin boots and registering gradations of the absence of moisture in still air. She perceived everything.

Half sensed how people lived before her Sobek eyes. Without intention, she observed the village. In that way, she knew transgressions not otherwise knowable. Battery, abuse, and theft. Secrets, neglect, exposure. Though at first she tried, Half could not confirm the truth for sure. And yet she saw everything so clearly. She dreamed exorbitantly. It couldn't be shut off or shut out.

In turn, the village felt observed. The feeling wasn't ignored or appreciated.

The thin man Sadiki spoke more directly. More even than the callused tongues of village elders.

"You have woken the Angry One. His eyes you imbue with life see. And in seeing they touch. And in being touched people become aware. Once aware they look your way. They are not happy.

"I see you too. I know you know not what you are doing. Nevertheless, you are hry-hb, the priest of Horus-Sobek. You pull Sobek from the ancient deep and it gladdens my scholars in their toil. Even as it frightens them.

He paused to let that sink in.

"You will presently come to the Scriptoria of Crocodopolis in Shedet. As our guest. You will learn the ways of a swnwt, sorcerer-physician to the Pharaoh. I am not asking. This will come to pass, and soon. If you delay long, you will not survive the animosity you have unleashed by those your radiant eyes threaten to illuminate.

Half saw dark hollows under his eyes. Was there blood on Anton's trouser leg? Amunet breathed rapidly close behind her. Details of the room warped under her concentration. She felt woozy.

Thirty feet away, at the front of the compound, sudden noise. Rough voices. An insistent hammering. Sadiki looked at Anton. Anton strode across the yard grabbing a large piece of wood as he went. The voices became louder. Sadiki lifted his bag and hurried Half and Amunet into the back garden out of the light.

Soon enough Anton reappeared. Collar torn, breathing hard. Sadiki slipped out of the compound through Anton's back room. Amunet exclaimed that they needed to stop and think.

Half was already packing her tools for a journey she had apparently precipitated. Everything was moving too fast. She had no idea where she was going. Could they just walk away?

She hoped Anton and Amunet had a plan.

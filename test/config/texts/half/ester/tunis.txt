>1931 - Cori is born in Tunis, Tunisia

Two thousand kilometers west Half stopped running and made a life in Tunis. She styled herself a French-Algerian on a low-rent street in |la Medina|, close by the |Bab El Jazira|, a block of mercantile townhouses gone a bit to seed. It was a bright third-floor apartment. Of course, Half was not French, though she spoke the language well, thanks to Anton.

By contrast, the apartment was authentic. Coarse mustard walls with maroon stencils. Faded rugs, cracked mosaic tiles, sky-blue trim. Balcony planters of rock-rose and |Cytinus|. Scents of thyme, coriander, and toasted sesame. Half could imagine starting a family.

She had become the second traveling wife of Jacques de Saulcy. By common-law, French custom. Jacques was a semi-retired professor of something he laughingly called Economic Dendrochronology. Was he being ironic? Half couldn't tell. Asking questions about his past just elicited more laughter.

Basically, Jacques was a rumpled man on the run from things. Among those things, a dull tenured position at the unprepossessing |l'Université de Besançon| and a fiancee named Danica that he said had underperformed the market. He rarely spoke of his past life. Jacques had ranged as far in the Francosphère from his former institution as was practical. Consorted with women. Smoked pipes. Avoided local politics.

Jacques was also a jocund and enthusiastic fibber. He told the skeptical regulars of |El Café| the colorful tales of an itinerant |Pied-Noir| academic. Of course, he was not one. Half humored him happily. If not untrammeled love, something more than enough for Tunis.

Now he was dead. Jacques had had a habit of drink. One night he didn't come home. The |Sûreté's| beat-walker found him rolled in a rough alley halfway home. It had happened late. There was a knife. Had it been his unguarded way of talking effusively in French to complete strangers while under the influence? The quarter wasn’t completely benign after dark. Half wished she knew more.

Losing him was sad. Still, it was just another thing to deal with. Half was used to the ground shifting. As a working mother with a cheap apartment and plain tastes, she knew she could keep her household together, even on her modest salary. She was an |aide soignante| and lab assistant at the |Institut Pasteur|. Typhus, Rabies, Bubonic Plague, and the so-called Arab Syphilis. It was a living that afforded the minimum. Life went on.

Half spent a long day at the Prefect. The inspectors' personal questions put her on guard. So much French! She gave identifying marks and identified his ring. No, she couldn't see the body. There were inquiries yet to be made. Things to set right. She would have to return. To Half, everything felt wrong.

The morning after the day following, Half woke disoriented. The body still hadn't been released. She decided to learn what she could for herself before anyone in authority could further pry. She would never have explored Jacques's trunk with him alive. Any more than she would have wanted him rifling her few belongings. She found outdated fashion, a few francs, and a woman's identity papers.

Jacques’s late wife had been one Ester de Saulcy. Half knew only that some years ago she had passed somewhere to the East. She tucked Ester’s passport away for surety. That night after work she sewed it into the inner hem of a skirt. Half felt it could come in handy.

"
Cori had come somewhat unexpectedly some months prior. It was summer 1934. Jacques had declared her to be Zolacurée. He claimed there could not be a more French name. Half loved the sound. Cori was a non-crier. Half bought her clothes cheaply at a charity. European in style. At home, she sewed wraps and shawls more in keeping with local custom.

It was so hot in the apartment. There was dust. Cori remained a wide-eyed quietness. At first, Half wondered what would make all well. Jacques reassured her. Though she knew he knew nothing of children, nevertheless, it helped. Eventually Half reached communion with her child. Life went on. Jacques and Half took Cori to the French consulate to make her an honest citizen of the Third Republic.

In that time, there were diseases creeping through the city center. Half's institute was a center of research into the illnesses endemic to North Africa. The work in the labs was anxiety-producing. Would she bring the Institute's work home? The doctors were French. Foreign residents. Early-career generalists. They were mixed in with non-clinical researchers. All labored to show the value of their investigations and care.

In the Institute’s cafeteria Half kept to herself. The others talked. Politics was in the air. It had a tinge of apprehension and edge. The most dangerous disease in the city center it seemed was foment. Half didn't like the way the wind blew. It was disquieting. Jacques laughted with the men in the |ahwa|. Half huddled with Cori behind closed doors in the heat.

"
After the rush to flee Egypt, Half had spent many months slowly moving town to town along the sea. She avoided Italian troops, nomadic peoples, and partisans. Her time in the Fayyum had been well spent. When money ran low she could practice village medicine well enough to eat. Half's name changed regularly with her appearance. She covered her tracks and stayed out of the sun. After weeks knocking about the plains around Misratah she took a garret in a part of Old Town known for its goats and cheese.

Jacques was a regular at the tiny first-floor cafe bar. Seated at a tiny table with graffiti carved in Arabic. He drank Turkish coffee from a silver |dallah| in tiny hand-painted Italianate |tazzinas|. When she took breakfast, he was there with watery eyes. When she supped, he was there with sun-shot eyes.

Eventually, they spoke. The Italian barman told Jacques her name was Miriam. Jacques offered Half a drink. Speaking French was a pleasant change for each, so it was repeated. They became friends in wandering conversations. They ate and walked the souk together. Charmed with their blasé falsity. Disarmed by opacity. Comfortable with each other's rootlessness.

Soon enough Half learned him. He was easy. Pick out any detail – say, the stained glass wind chimes, the barkeep's knife, or the cracks running vertically through the door – hold it up, spin it about to wind him up. Then sit back and listen to the exuberant free association.

The stained glass appeared to be of a rare handcrafted style born in Gozo, Malta. It was practiced by callused-foot Knights Hospitaller, retired. The art was to ceremoniously stomp marvered strata into lead forms, even as the hot glass fined out. Then induce various farm animals fed precise amounts of iron filings, cadmium flakes, and copper powder to urinate on the panes just so and so. The timing! The technique! Such that the glass bubbled, cracked, and patinated as it cooled in an irreproducible mosaic that the world treasured as |frits Il-Mellieħa|. He had seen such crystallized |souffle des anges| chime once in the nave of |Kon-Katidral ta' San Ġwann| in Valletta, behind the gilded stocks used to immobilize flagellants for their devotions. They soothed those inflamed souls.

It was complete bullshit. Of course it was. She knew it. And he knew she knew it. The sun slipped behind the walls. In the morning Jacques found the sun, the moon, and the stars tattooed on his hands in henna with the grace and precision of a master artisan.

"
In due time, the Italian army arrived, rounded up the Bedouin, executed key members of the opposition, requisitioned indiscriminately, and generally made town tense and uncomfortable. Jacques and Half left out of the West Gate on a cart with just a couple bags and a small trunk, and a few hours to get beyond the town curfew. The cart was slow. It was a long night.

In the morning, locked joints, and legs and arms rubbed raw. Dust in their noses and the corners of their eyes. They were out of water. Ruts. Headaches. No town. Expectations for much more of the same. For the first time in many months, Half found herself enjoying the road.

Half and Jacques soon found themselves in Tunis. It was good for a spell. Then winter. Italian fascists, antifascists and communists all briefly spun up nails-on-chalkboard broadsheets. The French establishment harshly shut them down. The great Charles Nicolle, founder of institute that employed Half, died. A reconstituted Tunisian Grand Prix nearly failed yet again, this time for lack of any French teams willing to face the strident Germans. Bankruptcies were rampant. Tunisia was turbulent.

"
Then one cold morning, scant days after Jacques was murdered in the alley, the gates didn't open. The Medina was choked with charcoal smoke and salt mist. There was confusion in the passages. Protectorate auxiliaries used trucks as barriers. Groups of rough unofficial men were going door to door, thumping and shouting.

The nursemaid didn't arrive. Cori was hungry. Half threw a dark shawl over her head, locked the door, ran downstairs, and dashed to the corner market. There were animals undriven in the street. Men with long guns. She bought bread and a container of yogurt. She rushed back towards the apartment. Shots echoed from the harbor.

Returning up the narrow street Half saw two unfamiliar men standing on the step outside to her walk-up. The door standing open. She pulled back sharply behind a delivery wagon. One man wore a dark dockyard hat. The other a blue turban. Cori was alone inside!

A shop door banged behind her. She put her head down and busied herself with the mule lines as if she were helping with deliveries. Two harried |gendarmeries| quick-stepped past. Batons out. She looked up. Blue Turban was walking quickly away. Dark Hat was joined by another man. They walked a bit too casually for that morning's confusion. Coming down towards Half, but on the other side of the street. She sat low down on the lazy board, head lowered, facing away from them towards the wall. Willing herself to be unobtrusive.

As soon as the men’s steps faded around the corner Half popped her head up. Seeing nobody, she ran for home. Slipping on the cobbles. Breathless. The door to the steps up to her apartment was a seven-foot fluted rectangle cut into a twelve-foot iron-bound arched door inlaid with brass studs. The greater door was such as might be found at the front of a mews. Both were faded Persian blue.

Half froze up. She near fell on the slick stones. Sounds faded out. Her pulse in her ears. There to the left of the inner door. A black symbol well-known to her. Low down. About five inches square. Stamped like a cargo stencil. The Eye of Sobek-Horus.

Half's balance wavered. Her eyes pull-focused. Momentum jammed her ring finger painfully against the door. Fell through. The yogurt and bread were gone. She reached her landing. Black ink on the door handle. She got the lock open and slammed the door. Cori was still on the bed. Silent. Only five minutes had passed.

In less than twenty minutes more, Half and Cori were on the street. Sling on her back. Travel bag on the other shoulder. Hard-soled shoes. Hunger forgotten. At the harbor, Half pushed through laborers and pushcarts to the edge of the dirty fish landing. The waterfront was busy, crowded, and smelled like death. Shouts and whistles. A man flew backward out a warehouse door in front of her. Head cracked on the cobbles.

Half didn't waver. She reached the pier. Paid a young owner generously to run her out to |la Goulette|. There she had to slow down to find the right vessel. No time for a real plan. Her first thought was |la Métropole|. She found a schooner heading for Port-Vendres with a cargo of |chemlali| olive oil. It would do. Half had enough francs to get her and Cori aboard. The skipper was gruff but willing. Customs agents had already been and gone. Reading from her documents:

"Welcome aboard, Mme Ester de Saulcy. S'il vous plaît. Keep below till we clear land.

When the lines were cast off an hour later Half opened the porthole in the closet berth she and Cori were crammed in. She gasped in deep breaths. Felt her hands shaking as the tension relented. And just like that, they were both French. Cori and Ester were going home to a world entirely new.

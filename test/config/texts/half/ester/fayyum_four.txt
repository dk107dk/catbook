After Sadiki visited Solomon to verify his possession of the eye he hurried to make arrangements. Less than a fortnight later, Mûsht and his team crept through Solomon's dark mansion. Sadiki expected to make headlines. He didn't anticipate Half's reaction to her incorporeal view of the operation.

Half continued to follow the story of Solomon Cicurel in helpless omniscience. Assuredly not a benign experience. Since leaving Reed Boatworks, she had lost what little control she had had. Her eyes would fly open. Her pounding heart would yank her from dead sleep paralysis to frantic arousal. The night terrors were becoming too intense. Her teeth were worn. Her hands were sore. The wall wore bloody spots. She didn’t know what name to call not knowing how to cope.

Each night started with quiet echoy hypnagogic hallucinations. Often soothing crooning melodies. Sisi's soft voice. She was lulled despite herself. Then the delirium. At its worst, thrubbing |basso profundo| growls would go off in her head. They might throw her against the wall or to the floor. Decades later Western doctors would call it Exploding Head Syndrome, after medical description got over itself. Long before the detonations she had normalized nightmarish lucid dreaming.

Just as with her original Sobek zoopsia, Half had quickly become perversely addicted. The somnipathy that took her was a kind of freedom. She floated and flew. She observed. She pursued.

Stories unfolded that were bizarre, fascinating, intricate, and often terrifying. More stories than the great Khédiviale Library in Cairo. Accounts she couldn't have imagined. Bedtime stories Amunet couldn't have told her. Blood and guts horrors Amunet wouldn't have allowed. Seriously, her head exploded!

"
Half breathlessly followed Mûsht's mission in Solomon's house to retrieve Sadiki's wayward eye of Sobek. An eye she had created. An eye she couldn't control.

Mûsht toe-heeled up the tacked-down Persian carpet. From plainly painted garden-floor rooms to a very different lifestyle above. Rich wallpaper. Ordinate moldings. Tin and plaster-cast twelve-foot ceilings. Parquet floors with dark marquetry accents. He listened. Swallowed and licked his lips. Somewhere there must be a kitchen. Perhaps liquor. He needed to focus. His first job was to ascertain the floor was empty. Then to unlock exterior doors. At each shadowy room, he softly rattled to prevent mistakes.

Mûsht knew the layout by heart. There were two fully above-ground floors in front. To the rear, four. On top a roof garden. The children lived on the third. Servants mainly the first and fourth, in back. Solomon and Elvire Cicurel lived in the grand second-floor front rooms.

The invaders would careful search the first-floor drawing room and the library. Likewise, the second-floor study and Soloman's private office. Only the master chambers were to be indiscriminately turned over. It was to look like a robbery. First though, the two goals. Mûsht headed stealthily up the sweeping stairs.

His partners were at the top as planned. Waiting in the reception area between the living space to the right and the study to the left. They pressed against the wall between display cabinets and palms. One either side of a long hall to the rear. Hand gestures. Mûsht and one of the others would enter the master bedroom to take care of the occupants. The third would start the search.

Outside, Sadiki continued to study his immotive pocket watch. Time held its breath and slowed down over Egypt. Silent shadows slid over one another. The bedroom door crept open gracefully. Deep carpet deepened. Air thick with sleep and the aromatic compounds of personal wealth. The oneiric moment came alive for Half as she floated over Cairo, far from her body shivering in her cell in Dionysias.

They drew up on either side of the bed. Mûsht, the larger of the two went quietly to Solomon. They took them quite differently. Yousif mounted Elvire like mule, kneeling on her arms, gloved hand in her mouth, and rapidly injected her in the neck. An opium-based anesthetic.

She went down quickly. Unresponsive in seconds. Fully unconscious in less than four minutes. It was a massive dose. She would wake after ten hours on the floor in distress. Later she would tell the police she was chloroformed. She hadn't been. Who knows why people say the things they do?

Meanwhile, Mûsht punched Solomon in the side of the head with a coin roll-fist. It was a stunner, not a knockout. Solomon had no fight.

In Dionysus, Half's sleeping fist slammed into the limestone wall of her cell. An insect buzzed. A desert dog barked faintly at a desert fox. In Cairo, Sadiki's watch clicked two a.m. The carriage horse clopped. In Solomon's bedroom, the floor creaked. A wedding picture fell on its silver face, black easel back in the air.

Yousif tied Elvire's wrists. He didn't gag her, instead flipping her over so she wouldn't choke on her vomit. Sadiki's plan didn't include her dead. Elvire's recent activities had been curated by the kemetists to imply a love triangle gone bad. Solomon was another matter.

"
The Cicurel family was large and powerful. Joseph Cicurel, Solomon's brother, was a radical. He hid immoderation behind pedigree and industrial pretensions. He was notionally acceptable to many elites, despite his only thinly deniable anti-colonial, pro-Zionist stance. Wealth satisfies wealth. That Joseph had not the flamboyance of his younger brother helped. His bite was worse than his bark.

Under his semitist ardor Joseph was deeply attracted to cabbals. He loved the intrigue of secret societies. He believed in the higher powers of ancient peoples. Kemeticism he saw as a natural ally. His support to them delivered a punch he couldn't himself swing at a corrupt regime he couldn't too quickly see the back of.

The atavistic nativist Sobek cult had seen Joseph as a credulous force multiplier. They offered him an artifact of religious significance. A beautifully ominous sculpted eye totem. With their concern for vision, it was ironic the cult didn't foresee their Trojan gift finding its way into the hands of his exhibitionist, loose-tongued, unserious brother. That was a mistake.

What was that gift that was so important? Half's eyes were each unique. Overall, their pattern was similar. They were drilled, scraped, chipped into rich substrates. Colored, epoxied, and enameled. Abraded and leafed.

Undulations of smooth muscle rolled under insulating fat. Knots, blemishes and folds of imperfect skin. Mottled with colors suffused from the mire shivers of a still river's margin. Heavy exumbrellar undulations bulged over protruding lenses with predatory slits. The cross of pupil and fovea drawing a carnivorous gunsight. Whatever the embodiment of that specific eye, it assuredly looked like death.

What might have it have achieved in Joseph's hands? Perhaps nothing. But pretty clearly there was another body of opinion. If you had asked Half, she would have stood mute. What can you say about the insensible that wouldn't sound silly? Do stone eyes see? Well, perhaps in some cases they do. Suspend your disbelief. Imagine what an intelligence network of Eyes Of Sobek might resolve. Perhaps the power to re-envision a people's future? Maybe.

"
Kerim slipped into the room. He carried a simple box about six inches high, twelve long. He handed the box to Mûsht and took the |kopis| knife. Solomon fixated his dazed eyes on the tip of the knife as he would an asp. Kerim went absolutely still. Staring into Solomon's eyes. Dagger point less than a foot from his mouth. Mûsht swept the dresser. The sound of falling objects deadened by deep pile. He placed the box gently. Opened it. Softly:

"Irt Sobek!

As Mûsht withdrew the eye reverently, Kerim put a hand over Solomon's mouth and began stabbing. Not long after, a double thump on the back of the carriage told Sadiki it was time to go. Haani stepped up and applied the reins.

"
Far away, Half awoke choking, screaming inside. Soon enough she quieted herself. Steadied her breathing in the cooler, drier air of her cell. What had she seen? Why had she seen it? Was it the future? Was it somehow her fault?

In her village, she had been able to investigate some of her dreams. She tried to make them make sense. In the desert temple she could only search for truth in her heart. Her heart was sick.

Half realized she had had enough. The carrion stench from the crocodile mouth was too much. Having decided she was done, Half realized she had been for quite some time. Restrictions. Evasions. Demanded obeisance. And above all, her family's disappearance. Why the crocodylia didn't see her natural reaction as the inevitable result was the final insult to her sense of herself as a person. They thought she felt honored? How clueless was that?

Instead of crocodiles, |psammomies|, the sand rat. Blond blurs on the wadi. Quick. Self-reliant. Clever and confident. Half saw them as a better tutelary. She suspected nobody else even saw them. She would follow their trail into the desert.

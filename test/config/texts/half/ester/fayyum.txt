The aura of Egypt darkened considerably that year. The interbellum was intensely political in North Africa and the Levant. Great powers flexed their muscles. The nationalist Wafd Party inflamed the masses. Islamic splinter groups multiplied and fulminated. Controversies, claims, and speculation were rife.

Under this froth there were deeper local currents less noted. One of those currents carried Half, Amunet, and Anton. In the slow, stately world of the Nile, it turned out to be a strong tug and fast. They were pulled under. From Read Boatworks to Asyut on the middle Nile, and from there through winding dark fields north to the Fayyum, an oasis sixty miles southwest of Cairo.

Starting from the Giza necropolis, Fayyum waited at the end of the barren Fayyum Desert Road. Few travelers pushed past the mosques and tombs of the silent new cemetery. They forded an unwalkable waste of packed sand. Eventually, the road dropped through the heat mirage into five hundred square miles of palms and farmland spreading between the low hills along the Nile, the Wadi El Rayan, and Lake Qarun.

Fayyum was the only oasis in the region not possessing its own water. Rather, its pocket of low land connected to the Nile watershed by a relatively narrow gap through the uplands. The main branch of the ancient canal ran through the Hawara Pass as the Bahr Yussef. For hundreds of miles, it fed dams, waterworks, smaller streams, irrigation channels, and other infrastructure. These works controlled the Nile floods. Even today, the Bahr Yussef channels somnolent mud-laden pulses into the swamps of Qarun, in old times Lake Moeri, now shrunken and gone saline.

The Canal passed ancient Shedet near its terminus. Shedet had long cherished the cult of the crocodile god Sobek. Its Greek conquerors called the city |Κροκοδειλόπολις|. By the time of the French and English there were no more crocodiles and no crocodile-headed god. Nevertheless, if somewhat ironically, it remained: |Krokodilópolis|. More recently it was simply the Madīnet Al Faiyūm. In ancient times Shedet had been a holy, strategic, and powerful city. High desert wrapped it from the north and west. Its stony uplands gave it space from the rest of Egypt.

"
When the tall, thin exegete known as Fellow Sadiki directed Half, Amunet, and Anton to Shedet he told them little. Anton obviously knew a bit more. Amunet and Half asked him questions. Anton told them what he could. Danger had followed Sadiki to their door. Their trust in Anton kept them from blaming him.

Anonymous fellows arranged a canal boat. The runners were to hide during the day and talk to no one. They made slow passage. At Dairout and Manshat they slipped from their felucca into the mud. They clambered up the bank, ran across fields, cut through unlit alleys. On the other side of the regulator they clambered down the bank onto another almost identical craft for their next leg down the channel. They continued until dawn. With each morning's light, Anton found a narrow branch or tall reeds to creep into.

Unknown to them, Sadiki's associates were meanwhile casing houses of the upper classes in Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and elsewhere up and down the Nile. Fellows watched those who had obtained one of Half's eyes. How did they know where the eyes were? The most believable explanation is that the kemetists were simply much larger than their light footprints. Were they among the servants of great houses, industrialists, and traders? What did they want? Many things would need explaining.

The runners had more immediate, simpler needs. They were sleep-deprived and traveling too light. In the evenings fellows met the boat every few villages. They gave a little food with less talk. There was never enough clean water. The boat slowly proceeded north by torpid current, oars, and occasionally sail. Disquiet and hunger grew. They ached from rowing.

When not rowing, Half stayed low in the bow. She watched the banks. Overgrowth, beached canal boats, and detritus. She had seen no crocodiles, as yet. Should she expect to? Her eyes more and more quickly picked out moving shadows. The flash of garments pulled around corners. Curtains swaying, doors shutting.

"
At their fourth dawn on the canal, they pulled the felucca up a densely treed bank. Reefed the sail into a tent. No fellows appeared. Village sounds woke. Donkeys and fowl. They were hungry. Privacy was nonexistent. Heat thickened the air. They attempted sleep. Anton kept the first watch.

Half eventually drifted off. Unremarkably, she dreamed Sobek dreams. She saw out the bloody eyes. She scattered carnelian flowers before unusual beings. An ancient face without flesh. A running child skinned with butterflies. Then her dream became fiercely lucid. She saw shadow hands raised in anger. They slid under the felucca's sail.

Waking with a start she saw shadows of hands on the sail above her. So close! Egyptian Aramaic. Hard voices whispering. Moving stealthily. She heard the word |cult|. She heard |apostate|. It wasn't said kindly. Half kicked Anton, quietly.

The boat had stones for ballast against sudden winds. Half carefully twisted. Her hands found one stone each. The fingers crept under the sail, lifting. She struck. Four pounds of rock. Anton moved quickly at the yelling hands, rushing out from under. There was a thud. She was tangled in the canvas. There were strikes and a noise that might have been a knife scraping a boot.

The felucca was roughly sloughed off the mud. Anton's sudden weight rolled it to the gunnel. He flipped back the sail and grabbed an oar. Projected an urgent low voice at Half.

"Oar!

Amunet rose, knocked her head. Gathered canvas. They achieved the middle of the canal. The current was but a couple of knots. They slowly picked up speed to a tepid jog. Amunet took another oar and they rowed. The sun was mid-afternoon. Half didn't look back.

By evening they had passed between the lights of Al Bahnasa and Sandafa Al Far. Just above the regulator at Sakoula town. Half and Amunet were exhausted. There was blood on the oars. At the last bend before the canal widened for the works they slowed. There was a darker offshoot to port. Half saw a light wave on the bank. Anton saw it too. He pulled them out of the main flow. The branch was twenty feet wide and four or five feet deep. As soon as the village lights were out of sight fellows threw a rope over the hitch. The bow slid to a stop.

Meeting the boat were an older |beladin| couple, along with a young girl. They passed rough food and river wine over the side in cotton-wrapped bundles. The man wore a crisp but worn |jilābiyah| over gray |sirwal|, the woman a dark wrap and |tarkha| headscarf. The girl dressed plainly and stood in the mud.

"We were attacked. Did you know? What can you tell us?

Anton was clearly not expecting a sufficiently detailed answer. Unlike most people, Anton had complete command of the strong impressions he gave.

"His eye sees all. We came as soon as we could. You were gone. Do not fear. What is not well he will make well.

Anton waited. The man continued after a beat.

"Darkness is safety. We will follow this duct around the Izbat. You will cross back to the canal on foot below the dam. They are waiting with a boat.

There was no new information in that for Anton. He moved on.

Amunet whispered with the woman. The girl was named Sisi. She looked wide-eyed up at Half. Her toes pointed in. Her fingers hid behind each other. Her hands twisted and turned, ready for flight. She looked as if seeking a protector. There were traditional designs in kohl and |kupros| on the backs of her delicate hands. Half was curious but didn’t have the energy to ask.

The man grabbed the bowline and tied it to a sycamore leaning over the channel. Fellow Adio then carefully removed his city shoes and rolled up his legs. He and Anton dragged the boat well up. From the canal, it would be unobtrusive. Anton watched with a blank face as Adio rinsed with ablution. Stepped carefully to a path and received a cloth from his wife. After careful drying, stood, mounted the berm above the path, looked about as if newly concerned.

"Quickly now. Follow the path. Remain quiet.

Adio led with shrouded lamp, watching for snakes. Half leapt from the bow to firm mud and stumbled up to the path. The girl caught her arm and steadied her. They turned to follow. Single file. Little moon. Half's calves were cramping. Her head ached and her face was tight with sunburn. Dizzy. She welcomed Sisi's touch as they walked. Tapping, pushing, reassuring. Within a few minutes lighted windows approached.

As they had at higher gates, they crossed where a village road crossed the narrowing channel. Slipped behind farm buildings. They filtered through adobe brick walls. Rocks clicked. A dog barked. They hurried through a wire gate and down into the damp fields heading back towards the Canal.

Back on the bank they saw the next boat. It was much the same. Light blue in dark water. Yellow painted eyes. Two hooded |felláheen| stood watch. Alert, carrying stout hoes. This was new. Adio didn't engage with the men. He shuffled their party towards the watercraft.

Then there was a sharp whistle from the other side. The |fellahs| stiffened. A light flashed off the water. An answering whistle from nearby on their side. Several heads jerked at once.

"What is this?

There was tension in Anton's voice. Half's fingers tingled.

"Go quickly. You are nearly to the city. He will protect you.

Just as he finished speaking an object – a rock? – thudded heavily into Adio's back. He reeled into the side of the boat, teeth first. Half saw the |fellahs| grappling with darker shadows. Swinging  wood and the sound of it cracking. Running feet and again the whistle. The woman, Kaa, pushed Sisi at Half.

"Sisi go.

To Half:

"She goes with you. Take her with His protection. We will follow.

The lamp shattered. Cries. Sisi made a clipped squeak and grabbed Half's arm. They tumbled into the rocking boat. And once again, oars in hands already wood-burned, they struggled to pull the water past the felucca faster than what was passed could follow. Sisi cried quietly under the splashing and the receding shouts. Who was she? All this, why?

Half soon entered a trance. She rowed through a deadening existential fog. It was not time for thinking.

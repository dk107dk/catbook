Slowly, as Half grew, Amunet changed. It was subtle. Certainly not disturbing. It was not, however, easily understood by Half. Not understanding was new.

Her mom had increased the number of traditional icons she produced. They lay about the house. Her work had begun to form a richer symbology. Common marriage charms became scarce. The new work had meaning.

Half also noticed that Amunet sold less and less to her usual customers. At the same time, more and more out of Anton's shop. Occasionally, even works on commission. Buying homeopathic amulets alongside healing powders made sense. The progression was easy to see with hindsight. Money grew less scarce as Amunet's ancient religious icons proliferated. The old gods! Curious stuff.

While Egypt was notionally secular, Islam was everywhere. It was not oppressive. The British took care of oppression. Despite a general air of rebellion, intolerance, and repressive apprehension, latent |Kmt| traditions were not ground down. Just the opposite. They were ignored. Seen as an insubstantial and essentially irrelevant form of backwardness. Low class. A bit disreputable. Left to flourish dimly in the damp cracks at the slippery waterline.

At that time, it was risky to be associated with many things. Pan-Arabists. The Sunis and Shia. Various nationalist groups. Liberalist anti-colonial intellectuals. Pearl-buttoned European apologists. Irredentists of the White Nile. Coptic heretics. Hold out Ottoman sycophants. The ever present British bootlickers. Or any of the dozens of secret societies that The Secret Service Bureau hounded till they fled into the arid hinterland.

All of these and more were more dangerous than an independent-minded peasant artisan uncommitted to wearing the |khimar|. Who cared if she fell into the orbit of a secretist foreign man? Impoverished |felláheen| were indiscriminately hanged for protesting the casual theft for sport of their food animals by well-fed British Army indolents. People had bigger problems. A hot wind was blowing.

Half ignored the world at that level. She was hard at work. Still, it was hard not to feel the disregard of the times, even in a small, middle Nile village. Unsubmissive widows? Bah! Followers of the ancients? Ha, insubstantial as the breeze. Craftsmanship? Dismissed. Disinterest in society's affairs? Barely worth askance looks.

In 1920, Anton reached an agreement with Amunet. He built a small room in the far corner of Amunet's walled ground. Stone, wattle, and adobe. It was built into the garden wall. The door faced outward on a rough path to the road. There was a lean-to for cooking and washing. Another appurtenant space for storage.

Nothing about the room suggested he would spend many waking hours on the premises. In the village, he repainted his shop and glazed the upper window. Anton took one or two convalescents at a time. His practice grew. Meanwhile, Half refrained from enlisting the goats in stone tumbling late in the evenings.

Half liked Anton. She offered to help him move.

"I could help bring your stuff over. Want to use the goat cart? I am used to carrying rocks, so I am stronger than I look!

They used the goat cart. Only a seaman's bag, a locked brass-cornered leather trunk, and some cardboard boxes. The trunk was fascinating. It had customs labels in French and English. It was heavy.

"What's in the trunk, Doctor Anton? It is from your home? Is Marseille your family's village? When did you leave?

Anton didn't answer. He didn't answer direct questions much. Eventually Half would learn that she significantly underestimated Marseille, but, yes, that was home. At least it had been home.

"I stopped belling the goats. We can stop the windmill polisher. I won't make a sound after dark. Maut says we can offer you dinners if you like. Her fattah is pretty tasty when she makes it.

Amunet's compound was set back from the road. It was separated from other houses by small fields. The former blacksmithy fronted a narrow beaten earth courtyard. It held various activities. Flower beds. An open-air lapidary workshop. A herb garden.

The rough walls were whitewashed. Worn mud bricks and carved |talatats| below, flat stones above head-level. Two stunted palms. A pole with a small windmill to power a lightweight polishing mill. At the back of the courtyard, a four-roomed house. Behind, a hypaethral kitchen with racks, sheets, and drawers. It occupied the front corner of another yard with a pen for goats, vegetable flats, and Anton's room and storage. About one hundred feet behind the back wall was a steep slope to the river.

Half knew her mom to be forward-thinking. However, the year Anton took up residence, images of Phthah, god of craftsmen, along with Ra and other powerful immortals, appeared on the inner wall. Hieroglyphs crept along the tops of rooms. Scrolls materialized in Amunet's studio. The stolen |talatats| built into the compound walls were unplastered. Amunet painted them in rich blues, reds, greens, and gold.

Amunet said little. Half asked questions, from time to time.

"Mom, what makes the old ways special? Were they real? Why don't other families know Ra, Isis, Phthah, and Hathor? Why does Anton always call me Hathor not Half, like everyone else? It’s odd. He’s a bit funny!

To questions she chose to answer, Amunet's answers were often insubstantial. Undeterred, Half shook her tumbler as if winding a spring.

"Why does the Doctor decorate his office with the ancient ones? He's not of Misr, he's an outsider. He's French. And I mean, that's good too, but why? Why so much stuffy history?

Amunet was discouraging.

"Leave the Doctor out of it. He is who he is. A good man. And it's far from your business what brings him here. Be glad he came! He helps maintain our lives and independence. Listen to him.

"
Half mostly occupied herself collecting and working stone. When not, she was with the river. Between the back wall of the compound and along the river was the papyrus. It had grown well. Anton had brought more. The plants had great meaning for him. Half didn't really understand it. She cultivated the reeds assiduously. They spread widely, more quickly than she expected. They rewarded her work so she worked harder.

"
One day, at nearly thirteen, she rescued a cracked oar from the sandbar near the house. Its paint was green. Where the paint had peeled off it was darker green. The oar fit a plan she had formed to build a boat. It was time, she decided. She cut and tied a simple Nile reed skiff, a |shabet|. Big enough for a scrawny teenager. And with it, a reed life preserver.

Half neither hid the little boat nor did she rush to tell her mom about it. She tucked it into the flourishing plants on the growing spit of marshland. It wouldn't blow away or be stolen. Her plan was to take it out the following week on her birthday. If it worked, she would make one for her mom so they could row together.

For many people the Nile meant crocodiles. Half had no fear of crocodiles. They said crocodiles feared reed boats. She wasn't sure why. Anyway, crocodiles were long scarce. Half had never seen one outside the market pens.

Soon after, that changed. Early on her birthday Half went to take the skiff out for its sea trial. An unusually long, low, muscular crocodile stood there. Lengthwise cradling her boat. Crushing the reeds. Waiting for her. Eyes unblinking. Massive gray-green bulk hardly moving. One foreleg resting easily on the side of the tiny skiff. It was truly a monster. She froze.

It was a moment she harshly repressed. For years, Half remembered that moment mainly in terrible dreams. Those eyes drawing her in inexorably till she was pressed through the slits. Simultaneously the jaw swung wide. Her substance passed through gullet and eyes at once. Deep ruby light poured into her as if the sun flushed from heat exhaustion. And the empty air echoed with the absence of sound, emphasizing the singular absence of a heartbeat in the dark veins at the back of those awful eyes.

The dream became more real than the memory. And the memory became ever more distorted with the retelling. Half retold the moment vividly in stone and glass. Powdered iron, sandstone, jasper, red granite, hackmanite, and garnet.

Eyes that bored deep. The crocodilian head on the god's body – |Sobek!| The claw biting into the dark igneous surface. The weight of that limb. But especially those eyes! Their wordless understanding. Carving by carving, each eye more lifelike than the last. Each more god-like than the last. A gaze unflinching, unrelenting, cold as stone. And yet weirdly, slowly, becoming her animate, her beast, her protector. Ultimately it was her eye she carved.

Gradually Half overcame her terror. She found her rightful place living as the mortal ghost behind the eyes of fearsome Sobek. Not the girl facing the monster, not daring to breathe. Instead, the bright figurehead of a living battleship forcing the lane from the brilliance of Luxor north to brooding Shedet. Her eyes flaming. Bold black kajol lines streaming. Hair whipping with the speed. Clapping to the beat of the claws churning through the current. Piercing the horizon with those terrible timeless eyes.

Oh, the sights Half saw. She had had no idea.

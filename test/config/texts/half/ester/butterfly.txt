>1928 - A note to Sisi hidden in a glass crocodile

|My little faraasha, it is time to go. Dry your wings and float away. Leave this broken toy and all your things and go quickly. Keep only this eye of mine to guide you. Wear it always, out of sight.

|Fly unpredictably as the tiger moth. But if you are cornered you must cut them with sharp tiger claws. Fly away now little sister. Wherever you go, I will be above you. You will never be alone.

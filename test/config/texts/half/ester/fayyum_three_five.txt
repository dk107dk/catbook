On |al-Rihama|, in Cairo's Giza District, Mahmood al-Farid, known as Mûsht, brutalized a fine escutcheon.

The heavy door was blue. Three bowed marble steps down from street level. Handle of brass. Mûsht could not have afforded a door like this one. The house as a whole was unfathomable. He had to maintain his imam's |zakat| to keep up appearances among the |jamaat| brethren. Moreover, his brother-in-law's family was still on the rocks. So many mouths to feed! A house like the one he was breaking into was built of money. It was distracting.

Despite his penury and dismay, the lock broke. The door eased open. He shook a child's rattle softly as a signal. Mûsht slipped into the dark.

The Villa Cicurel was a welcoming stucco and sandstone mansion. Quite unlike the cold granite of many of Cairo's elite abodes. Steps swept gracefully up from either side of the gravel walk to a second story barbican-like portico offering a view into the entrance hall framed by slender columns with modest ionic capitals. The hall glowed as rooms do when lit by tall candles, scented lamps, and innumerable mirrors.

Two floors down, Mûsht paused. Unfamiliar smells. French perfume, gentle cleaning liquids, sweetwoods, incense. He could not smell food, mud, or the toilet. That left him at a loss as to what part of the house he was in. It was a footman's quarters. Then unoccupied. Mûsht struck a match.

He had come with three men. One was Fellow Sadiki. Most such nights Sadiki was not present to micromanage. Nevertheless, in this case, mistakes had been made. Sadiki was determined they should be corrected. He sat stiffly in a gentleman's victoria. He checked his silver pocket watch.

While looking taut, in fact, Sadiki's mind wandered. The house was a calligraphic puzzle. The frieze and moldings, pendants and transom lights, shutters, and their dentils, all sported elements echoing the letterform of Pharonic Egypt. As with the old script, the pen was distinctive.

A rail failed to be mechanically straight. Subtle character conveyed by balustrades fractionally misaligned. Strapwork moulding obviously hand-carved. Indeed, the window lintel nearest the door to the right was clearly six inches narrower than that to the left. Nonsensical! Yet, as such, profound. Such is the ancient penmanship of Cairo on even its newer parchments.

Sadiki had come with three men. One was inside. Two round back. Presumably also in, or they would be soon. The agents were to find two things and leave with one. The first, an |objet de vertu|. Expected to lie with the jewelry. The second was Solomon Cicurel.

Solomon Cicurel was not expected to survive the encounter. Moreover, anyone unexpected would also not survive their encounter. Sadiki's crew were not fooling around. He didn't expect to wait long. Nor did he think to hide.

"
That morning Half had been tetchy, itchy, and argumentative. She had spent too long in the sun, to the detriment of her face. A passive aggressive defiance of Soki and Kaala, Preceptor Single of the House Of Life. It hadn't done much good. Kaala assigned her a |sebayt| as a corrective.

Half was to copy the |Maxims of Ptahhotep|. And she was to choose one stricture to live by. Sourly, she chose: |Think of living in peace with what you possess. What the Gods choose to give comes of its own accord.| It felt ironic, and yet also optimistic. She scratched her peeling nose. Went to find food. Tried to avoid people.

Her pocket held a stone. Whitish with cracks of pale blue. She found it behind a box in one of the storerooms. It had come of its own accord. That made it hers. Half was thinking of crafting an eye of her own with it as the pupal. A secret eye for seeing only secrets she actually wanted to see.

The week had been quiet. Fellows were on the road. They assembled rough men in ragged work yards. They gathered farmers in their fields. The temple's empty halls echoed.

Half's sunburned face and cranky attitude cracked. She retreated to her cell and wrapped herself in the sheets. Annoying Ptahhotep platitudes buzzed over her near the dim ceiling. Below them Half became the night fly. Compound eyes twitching in the heat. Perched on the filmy teeth of Sobek, breathing crocodile breath, staring coldly at the world without blinking.

Half didn't know Solomon Cicurel or Mûsht. Nor had she had many dealings with Sadiki. She had no context for the inexplicable story she watched unfold. She was long past believing she could control her visions, any more than she governed her person. She was along for the ride.

"
Solomon was a leading businessman of the new, cosmopolitan Cairo. The son of Moreno Cicurel, a Sephardi Jew whose ancestors had gradually migrated across North Africa to Egypt. The family arrived at the end of the nineteenth century. Moreno had come with the purpose of commerce. With his three sons, he built an empire. They briefly brought the glamour of the cosmopolitan North to the ambitious East.

Through diaspora support, astute investments, and a little luck, Solomon was able to found the core of the family business: an upmarket store in the Cairo business district named |Au Petit Bazar|. The store's initial success was driven by its owner's good taste and a rapidly growing middle class. In a few years it became an institution.

Sensing opportunity Cicurel upscaled and scaled out. His ambitions grew. Soon, the family commenced a high-risk redevelopment of |Au Petit Bazar| into a massive flagship. |Les Grands Magasins Cicurel et Oreco|. A department store to rival those of London and Paris. Cairo was ready. The family was catapulted to the elite. Expansion followed success. Wealth followed expansion.

Solomon, son of Moreno, was a talented businessman. But not only that. He was a connoisseur. Not only of finery and fine wines. Also of culture and history. Solomon gave richly to museums. In doing so, he gained attention.

His gifts were for the pleasure of changing the conversation. Were mummy portraits the rage in conservators' salons? Solomon relished using his money to redirect the spotlight to, say, papyrus cataloging instead. Not because one slice of history was more important than another. Nothing so thoughtful. It was simply because he could. He was a pleasant, manipulative son of a gun.

And there's the rub. Through the world of ancient history, Solomon had unwittingly made connections to the modern kemetists. In their world, hidden power lay behind the facade the foreigner's Egyptian fetish saw. An unnamed, unremarked sect of crocodilian fanatics crawled Cairo. Among its leaders, one we already know: a bookish man-about-town, known as an erudite specialist on the abstrusities of the |Theban Book Of the Dead|, as well as an unexpectedly amusing cocktail conversationalist – Doctor Ani Sadiki.

Knowing Sadiki was Solomon's gravest mistake.

"
Mûsht broke and entered a wealthy Giza estate as a consequence of a cocktail party. In her ethereal somnaviation through Cairo, Half found she was privy to the world of cocktail parties. A spectacle far more foreign to her than a plastic and steel reflex hammer had been. What was that cocktail antecedent to Mûsht's larceny? One evening Sadiki bearded Solomon in his native habitat in hot pursuit of something of Half's.

"Ah Doctor, my good friend, well met! When did we talk last? Was it the Antiquarian's Annual in March? You spoke of the symbology of the Eye Of Horus, yes?

Sadiki did not count Solomon among that small group of people. But yes, he remembered when.

"A pleasure to see you my august imaxy of commerce. So kind of you to remember my soiree ramblings. I take it as a great compliment to the attractions of our native cultural milieu.

Solomon was not in the least discomfited to be cast into the bucket of foreigners. He, of course, did not catch the ancient honorific. They talked as if social equals. They were not. Later that evening, just before leaving, Solomon encountered Sadiki again.

"My dear provedore, a word?

Solomon was easily flattered by the attention of experts.

"Of course, Doctor. What might I do for you?

Sadiki had waited hours for this moment.

"Well now, I have this evening come into an exciting fact. If true, I am truly grateful to the fates that I happened to learn it.

Solomon was amused by Sadiki's obsequious fluster.

"May I help you settle a matter? What have you heard?

Sadiki exuded conspiratorial.

"A whisper, and it may be nothing more than an insubstantial whisper. It is said that a piece has come to light. A most extraordinary piece. A l'objet d'art of unexpected import. Well, you know of my work? It is a piece that would make of the discoverer a réputé incredible as a patron of the philosophical analysis of ancient times.

Sadiki ran out of breath.

"That sounds a piece of wondrous importance. Out with it man, what are you saying?

Sadiki's wisdom teeth briefly locked. Then in a flowery breathless rush.

"The ancients believed in gods and syncretic powers. They paired raptors and ibex. Snakes and hyrax. Crocodiles and the Sun. Sobek and Horus. Sobek and Ra. Creators, destroyers, wise protectors all.

Solomon stared.

"The combination of the crocodile and the hawk god Horus was a particular visage of the Pharaohs. They created statuary, depictions in stone, paintings, jewelry, and more. And they cast spells to incarnate the forms of Sobek in objects of beauty. A vision of a living god evinced in art. They made many such pieces. Over the eons, a few of the most celestial importance were lost.

Solomon thought he knew what was coming.

"It seems one such icon was recently recovered from an incompletely ransacked corner of the nearby Necropolis. If it were verified to be what it might be, it would be of great scholarly importance, to say nothing of inestimable value. An eye rendered in stone, ceramic, glass, and perhaps even miraculously untouched liquids. The terrible and piercing eye of Sobek-Horus! It would be beyond ancient. The Middle Kingdom, perhaps. Perhaps earlier. A find that would make careers and amaze the world.

Solomon knew he had been right. This was a florid description of a remarkable find he held in his collection. It was a recent purchase by a family member that had been unusual of itself.

"Sir, has this virtu come lately into your possession? I ask as one who can humbly help you investigate its import, properties, and value. I ask in the hope of just a few minutes with the object. Completely in confidence, of course. A great favor would it be! And I hope a great benefit to yourself.

That was it. It was all Sadiki had. It exhausted him to wear that simpering academically incontinent character. It either worked or it didn't. And after a pause, it did. Solomon, flattered, intrigued, and greedy, took the bait. At what cost! He offered Sadiki an audience the following Tuesday evening.

"
Sadiki arrived on the appointed hour at Villa Cicurel, No. 57 Road 17, about one hundred yards across from |Mudiriat 'amn Aljiza|, the Giza Security Directorate. A secure and tony part of town. He walked up the gravel to the carriage turn getting into character. Up the marble steps to the doorman. He was curt to his own, in his own tongue. Inside, the Chief of House welcomed him and clapped for tea.

A servant's bell told Solomon his guest had arrived. He repaired to the Drawing Room, tapping the bell cord to inform his staff. His dragoman Haani entered the room silently from the courtyard. He prepared pipes. Solomon took a chair. He liked to look relaxed when visitors entered. The ceiling fan made hardly a fly's whine. The mantel clock was louder.

"Ah, Professeur, it is good to see you, welcome. Come in and sit.

Sadiki mopped his face with a plain silk handkerchief. Hesitant to sit before his patron.

"I don't believe you've met Haani, my secretary. Anything you say to me, he may also know. Haani has been with our family a long time. My brothers and I rely on him immensely.

Sadiki nodded to Haani without a sign of Solomon's overstatements. Was pleased to meet him. Gave every indication of excitement to get to the heart of the meeting. But, of course, Solomon was in need of refreshments and smoke and chit-chat.

He spoke of politics, the institutions, the economic situation, and men's fashion. Which thankfully all vorticed, at least sufficiently much, towards the matter at hand: an ancient cultural artifact taken by a foreign patron of the art of looting Egypt for fashionable trinkets. Unintentionally confessional inanities. Sadiki's twitch wasn't entirely just in character.

Eventually, they got down to it. Haani clapped for a servant who he instructed to stand outside the door. Lamps were unshaded. Solomon set his tea aside. He rose and pulled a |senneh kelim| throw from a matte gunmetal fire safe with discrete gold leaf chasing.

Soft, oily clicks. Sadiki was on his feet. Haani stood very straight. Solomon placed an unfinished cedar box on the table. It was about eight inches high. Brass hinges. Brass clasp. A dark lentic hide wrapped the edge from inside over the chamfer. Similar hide edging unfolded from within the box proper. The initials SMC were burned in the raw lid.

Sadiki muttered |sotto voce|, having come up behind Solomon. Solomon was not used to people standing close behind him.

"This is a moment for you, I see. I'm beginning to understand the potency of this object, if it is what you are expecting.

Sadiki wished Solomon would move. The moment that box opens, he thought, my mood will crash to the floor. It will be tough to not just break his neck and walk out with it. Let's get this done, damn it!

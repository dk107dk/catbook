>1951 - Half keeps watch from Holmes Chapel

Unlike Sadiki, Half didn't think of her house as a house of secrets. But was it?

She rifled through the facts. Edward knew Ester was born in Egypt. That she had married first in Tunisia. That she was French. Except that she wasn't. He knew she fled the Nazis. He didn't know she'd been fleeing long before. He didn't know her birth name. He knew she was a rare artisan. He didn't know she was a sorceress.

Now, the Colonel. Thanks to him she knew Edward didn't know his own family tree as well as he thought he did. There were mysteries at the edge of consciousness. Did he realize?

Perhaps because of such, Edward's love for his adopted daughter ran deep and warped all. He had seen magical creations fly about Cori's head, flashing in the sun. He knew she was exceptional. He had not looked closer. Perhaps he hadn't wanted to look? Does not looking create secrets?

Half had never worried about Cori. Cori could take care of herself. She was nearly the same age as Half had been when Half stepped on the dangerous path out of Reed Boatworks. Her mother had ultimately let go. She did so in the hopes of protecting Half. She paid for Half's protection with her life. Half was likewise willing to let go in the hopes of regaining Cori.

And how had that worked out? So far? Seemingly not well.

Cori had left suddenly. She left Edward and Ester to dig into many things. Things that hadn't to that point been finely sifted. There had been tense days. He had wanted to run after Cori. Half had insisted he allow things to take their course. She prevailed, as a mother often does. Had she been wrong?

After a few frantic days Half had, with trepidation, opened a locked closet. The house was still. She retrieved a fereter from a locked lead-lined cedar chest. Within the locked fereter, a linen-wrapped artifact in the form of an eye. The hawk eye of Horus. Ever since, the eye had lain on her chest day and night. With it she watched over her child.

Then that man, that Colonel Noshunse, had come. So unexpected. Seeing him on the steps, her mind flew to Edward. Noshunse had occasionally been a presence. But it was always Edward, never Cori. Why would the Colonel know of Cori?

And she had had no warning. Because apparently, Noshunse had circumambulated back to her door by way of a young man, Phaeton Athair. Cori had attached herself to him. Half knew him only as another presence, not a person. Apparently, a presence more dangerous than she had thought.

And it seemed the Colonel knew her, now, better. What caused him to research her? To dig into her history that she had so carefully elided. Apparently, her husband was more than he appeared. Likely more than he knew. And that brought Noshunse's occasional presence into focus.

All things circle in the gravity of time till they are sucked down. Swallowed whole. That felt just and inevitable, if uncomfortable. Some know that they circle so. Before Half suspected. Now Half knew.

That night the dream state had hit her like a locomotive. She saw the chase. A ship. A burning star hurtling down from the sky. And another presence. In fact, two. From so far off in tangled spacetime, the two presences were all but joined. A one-eyed gunman with hatred on his face. And a compound eye with the jaws of a crocodile. The eye's terrible jaws sang with the sweet voice of Sisi. Little lost Sisi singing songs of retribution with a voice of thunder.

Roused, Sadiki's violent band charged at Cori. Sisi stalked Sadiki, preparing for predation. A danger unknown chased her child out of France. And the cavalry charge of her questionable champion looked to burn a relativistic hole in the timeless sands of Egypt. Half shivered in the cold dark north. She prepared to soar into a hot southern battle.

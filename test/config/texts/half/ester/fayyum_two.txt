The canal village skirmishes diminished day by day as they approached the city. Half, Sisi, Amunet, and Anton were met by boats outside Shedet. Soon, having arrived at their destination, they debarked at a busy public dock. It was mid-morning. The runners ate |feteer meshaltet| in the shade with fellows. They drank black coffee from white cups decorated with green crocodiles. The square bustled. No one looked at them twice. All seemed surprisingly well.

At mid-afternoon a covered mule cart took them to the south gate. They turned southwest. Fellows took turns leading the way on a horse. The road was flat. Desert-dry. Despite that, the fields remained lush, irrigation channels full. Soon they saw sand beyond the fields to their left as they followed the edge of the oasis west.

Four hours later the sun was low. The cart crossed into arid country. There was dust. They ate hard flatbread. Their water was near gone. In time, fields gathered again on either side, though less lush. The mules drank mud. Their guide returned with lamb and grilled vegetables. Half slept poorly on raw hips as they bumped along.

She awoke in the desert again. Small dunes, ancient wadi, yardangs. The air was still, the stars magnificent. It was cool. Presently they arrived at a solitary structure. Qasr Qaroun Temple. Brands burned in welcome beside a colossal-order portal rising three stories. Massive sandstone blocks glowed and faded upward to black out the stars.

Their mules stumbled to a halt with Sisi and Half leaning groggily on each other. Anton carried Sisi inside. It was dark. There were echos. People shuffled without speaking. The inhabitants wore veils and masks. Half drank cool sweet tea. Then she found herself and Sisi alone in a narrow chamber with two low beds. They slept in one.

"
Half woke curled around Sisi, keeping her warm. Breathing her travel-musky hair. Day entered through a square two-foot window about fourteen feet up. But for a linen over the passageway, the stone room was a cell. She listened. The walls were close. If she could not sleep, she wanted out.

Qasr Qaroun Temple was a one-hundred-twenty-five-foot long, ninety-foot wide stone edifice standing alone in the desert. Its sheer walls rose fifty feet to a pronounced cornice. The walls were of dry ashlar blocks ranging from one hundred pounds to ten tons. By Luxor's monumental standards, the temple was small. In human scale, it was massive.

The ragged edge of habitation was a mile further west at Minshat Qarun. A processional dromos pointed in that direction. To either side of the broken dromos were the ruins of Dionysias. The ruins were not impressive. Dismembered walls, unaccountably straight lines, and detritus embedded in the stony desert pavement. The landscape was primeval, bone-dry, and unyielding.

Half would learn that Lake Moeri had lapped the temple in ancient times. Dionysias had been a small but thriving agricultural community. The Ptolemies granted land to Greek immigrants more than twenty-three hundred years ago. While given life by the lake, the town had been anchored by its outward-facing role at the edge of the desert. Qasr Qaroun's ascetic monastic order stood an armed watch at the wild edge of Sobek's domain. The last Ptolemaic outpost protecting Bedouin camel trains heading to a thin archipelago of oases deep in the Western desert.

Within, the temple was a labyrinth of prayer rooms, halls, sacristies, a library, scholar's cells, and apartments. There were dozens of spaces on just the first floor surrounding the |sancta sanctorum|. The temple had three floors. Above those, a labyrinth of wood-framed structures crowded the flat roof. Between them, solar clocks, monuments, and an observatory. Below ground, two levels of storerooms, crypts, wells, and other dark spaces.

Before fleeing Reed Boatworks, Half could have counted the number of buildings she had seen taller than two floors on one hand. She had never been in one. There were so many rooms.

"
Half tentatively ventured from the dorter she woke in. She breathed shallowly, listening. Subtle noises made an impression. Behind her, a sudden rustling. A tall woman in a black veil was right on top of her.

"Welcome to Dionysias, Hathor Mutneferet! Welcome to the Temple of Sobek.

Half spun in the narrow passage. Raised her head to find the voice. Her fingers tensed on the rough stone pressed against her back.

"I am Sokonopi Nepherses. Curator of records. Transcriber of the Book Of the Fayyum. You are our honored guest. Allow me to introduce our community. Come!

Thus began Half's life within the walls. The sect had determined she would stay at their western periphery. It was safer for her, they said. She would return to Shedet in due course, they said. Why the world wasn't safe for Half was not made clear. What would make it safer? That was likewise left cloudy.

Half was to help build the new cloister forming at Qasr Qaroun. The grounds and environs were vigorously under construction. Men man-handled stray boulders. Quoins and fallen pillars raised. New blocks fitted to gaps. One-ton cavetto hoisted into the degraded cornice and pinned with iron. As the archaic streets were uncovered, fellows quickly raised simple stone and rammed earth walls with reed roofs. More people arrived every day.

That first morning Half's questions were mainly about family. Was Anton was helping with the building projects? Would Amunet work in the community alongside her? Finally, she just asked.

"Is my mom even still here?

Sokonopi, or Soki, was circumspect. But no.

Supposedly, Amunet and Anton were fine. They were working hard to keep Half safe. It was an unsatisfying answer. Soki wouldn't say more. What little Soki gave her was what she was going to get. The few others she interacted with were distant, formal, and oddly deferential. It was weird.

The fellows handled Half gingerly. It was as if she were an unworldly being. In those first days, no voices were raised no matter how temperamentally she behaved. They said, what the gods revelled must be accepted, even if not understood. She heard a variations over and over. It was never clear if she was to accept the cult without understanding it, or if they felt they had to accept her without understanding her. Either way, to Half, it sounded like an excuse for not thinking.

As she appraised the temple, a classification of her was apparently underway. Half sensed controversy. Was she a simple mystic? Or maybe some kind of super weapon? To the prelates she was an unwitting novitiate. To the physicians, a delicate, difficult instrument. To the artisans, a child savant. From Half's perspective, as the newness wore off, she increasingly just felt like a caged bird.

Soon after, Half had yet another day of introductions to new people and their precious activities. It was awkward and long. When she was returned to her cell she realized she hadn't seen Sisi all day.

"Where is Sisi? When can I see her?

Soki paused to look down at her. While Half's question had been direct, her eyes rose only to Soki's mouth.

"Sisi is nearby. You will see her again in a few days. Eat now. Afterward, we will visit Per Ankh, the House Of Life. The scholar-physicians are eager to learn from your craft.

It hit her: at least for a time, she was alone.

Even as she absorbed her loss, Half also caught the first reference to her eyes. She had expected it. Her family's rushed exodus was due to her Sobek carvings. The attacks on the canal too? Seemingly! Was any of it real? What was the greater struggle she had unintentionally joined? Answers were not forthcoming. Fellows, scholars, priests, physicians, and workers were closemouthed. They politely dissembled.

The next day Soki led Half to the roof again. A pair of rooms had been built in the southwest corner. One with a triptych gallery. Outside, three rows of benches looked in.

"This is your workshop and classroom, S»ùq Swnwt! Here you will teach the physicians to make materials live. The same as they will teach you to keep the living alive in the House Of Life. Come inside. Tell us what tools you need for your work. Whatever you need you will have!

Half was fairly certain that statement was not accurate.

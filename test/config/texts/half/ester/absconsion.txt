Over several days Half tucked away dried food from meals. Then she realized she could steal food any time. She imagined burrowing out of the temple. That was nonsense. She could walk off the grounds anytime. There were no walls to scale.

Water was a problem. Unlike the sand rat, she could not drink saline water or suck moisture out of desert plants. She would need a waterskin. Most likely that would require stealth. Pilfering food from the basement storerooms was easy. Absconding with a full waterskin meant finding the right time to enter the kitchen. The skin must be there. It must be full. It must be unattended. She must be invisible.

Even if, it was not that simple. The problem was Amunet, Anton, and Sisi. She wanted them to run. Were Half gone, they would be of no further use to the Fellows. Any chase would probably be half-hearted. She would return to find them. Someday.

The devil was in the details. Where were Amunet and Anton? Where was Sisi? How would Sisi get to them? Half suspected she was often drugged. That would be bad. If not that, then it was worse. She didn't know how to release a lost soul. Still, having no options, Half proceeded.

The plan that emerged was intricate. It combined subtlety with redundancy. And it relied on a generous helping of magical thinking. Luckily there was no shortage of magical thinking close at hand.

Five works of art were needed. Two unlike anything she had done before. One exceptionally grand. She thought it might take all-in-all four to eight weeks. Much depended on the materials available, the help of Bahri, the glassblower, and the conscientious assistance of her unwitting minders. It took longer, of course.

The plan was in the form of a crocodile's jaws. For Sisi's jaw, Half would create a "birthday" present for Sisi. She trusted the Fellows to deliver it if it took the right form. A glass bauble for a youngster in the form of a cartoonish crocodile. Respectable but common. Merely Half reaching down to encourage a young novitiate. They were sure to give it to her.

The opposing jaw addressed the problem of Amunet and Anton. She would create a truly magnificent eye of Sobek. It would be sent off as her routine monthly offering. However, Half would find a way to make it unusual. She would claim it was done in thanks for her and Sisi's birthday month. Half hoped the Fellows weren't keeping track of who was actually born when.

The magnificent eye would distract attention from a lesser companion piece. A half-finished eye that Half would ask the Fellows to give to Amunet to complete. Completing it for Sobek was to be Amunet's birthday present to Half. The unfinished eye would require some element of skill only Amunet could provide.

The Fellows would see the alluring but incomplete work as too rich to abandon. It would be given to Amunet to finish. Amunet might immediately realize several things. First, it was not Half's birthday. Second, the incomplete gift might be interpreted as a signal that Half was leaving, thereby making the two of them incomplete. And third, speculatively, if Amunet was enough gifted, the eye might show her where Half then was, or where she was heading, or even just the absence of Half. As said, the Fayyum encouraged magical thinking.

All the magic was troubling. Yes, an eye might help Amunet. But what might it or the other dozens of eyes of Sobek offer Fellows following Half? She had no idea. In the daylight Half was skeptical her works had power. The evidence of the night didn't bear thinking on.

As works of art, all of Half's eyes were amazing, each in its own way. Here, Half outdid herself. As indeed she felt she must. Even the incomplete eye was a rare work, despite the signifying state she left it in for Amunet.

Sisi’s glass crocodile toy was something new. It was more interesting. Bahri was happy to help. She knew what she was doing. She hoped she would not be answerable for it later. Together they blew a somewhat bulbous glass crocodile body. It was about five and a half inches long. They formed muscular legs with clawed feet. A long head with sneering lips and tiny vents in the nose. A spiked tail, slightly curving.

Tail, legs, and snout would be joined and annealed. First, Half separated the body cleanly behind where the ribs would be. From the inside, she frosted the already dark glass by first scouring it with coarse sand, and then coating it in limewash.

In the rear cavity Half secreted three objects. The first was a note from Half to Sisi with the basics of the plan, which summed up to essentially:

"I'm out, you run!

The second item was a life-size and wonderfully daedal human eye. It was carved from the unusual white and blue rock Half had pilfered from the storeroom and carried for months. She stringed it on a goatskin lace. Sisi was to sleep with the eye on her neck. It might show her which way to flee to reach Amunet. Would that work? Suffice that others seemed to think her eyes had those powers. Her own experience didn't convincingly refute it. So perhaps?

The third object for the toy was a tiny flat spring hammer. Another thin strip of steel, glued at both ends, created torsion. That second strip was to the spring as a string is to a longbow. The tolerances were fine. When the top strip's glue powdered and let go, the spring would jerk down on the glass. It would hit on the crack where the two halves of the body would be frangibly joined.

Making a spring is not a simple job. Luckily the physicians had thin steel strips for braces. Even more luckily, Amunet had married a blacksmith. After a couple of splintered strips, Half quenched a working spring. She tested the tensioner glue's longevity in sun and shade. She tweaked the compression on the spring. She cracked much glass to perfect the hammer action. Finally she was ready.

Bahri helped Half join all the parts together. They did not anneal the body join, leaving it brittle. They rubbed glue into the air holes in the snout to protect the spring’s glue until it was time. Finally, they scoured and limewashed the outside a greenish gray. They hid the finished product away in a cool place.

The fifth and last work of art was something new: the eye of a hawk – |Horus!| The purity of the hawk god, divorced from the overbearing crocodile deity. An eye that might look down from high enough to see a way through the wastelands. An eye that could spot even a tiny sand rat. And as it was her eye, hopefully, it would be an eye that guided sand rats, not ate them. In a world of miracles, even this last stretch seemed possible.

Soon after, Half simply walked into the desert.

And then one year, shortly after their anniversary, Aalunae told Charles she was pregnant. Unfortunately, she had to do it by telegram to Nome. Charles was at that time tangled up with Wrangel Island yet again. The incorrigible Vilhjalmur Stefansson had raised funds. He had roped in two-brace of men. One pair experienced. The other pair just a couple of lads, really. They shipped with a native woman to occupy Russian territory in an aggressive simulacrum of colonization. Calling it a suicide mission would have been too dramatic. Regardless, it had not been a good idea. The Russians just ignored it. And rightly so.

To his credit, Charles had ultimately refused to join up. He had undertaken to assist with the research and planning. And, while not fully admitting it to himself, he had toyed with going. In the end though, he knew he had no business signing up. It was to be a dangerous one-to-two-year mission in service of someone he didn't believe in that would take him away from his new life with Aalunae. Moreover, unlike in 1913, it wasn't exploration. It was, in essence, a misguided attempt at plunder. Not his thing.

Then in 1922, Charles had gotten an urgent summons from Stefansson to help crew what was increasingly looking like a rescue. Stefansson was urgently seeking a ship, a small but experienced crew, and funding to mount an extraction of the shore party on Wrangel. Charles was superficially reluctant. However, he was clearly torn. Aalunae would not stand in the way. She saw that her man, with regards to matters polar, despite the loss of three digits, had not yet hit rock bottom. And it was hard to argue with his attempting to help save lives.

After wavering for days Charles cabled Stefansson his intention to join the mission. Reluctantly or not, Charles left Aalunae on Kendal Station platform heading to sea. The first salt he tasted was his own tears. And yet his heart also beat faster than the clack of wheels on stock joints carrying him to the coast.

By most observers at a distance from the Arctic Circle, the mission to Wrangel was not thought considerable. Just a late summer run well in advance of the dark. In 1922, a known path of but six hundred miles. Safe in the lower forty-eight, armchairs compared polar exploration notes with barstools.

As Charles progressed closer to Nome and the realities of a difficult arctic season, opinion became progressively more grim. Stefansson had published that year from New York a popular travelogue of the Canadian Arctic Expedition titled |The Friendly Arctic|. That same year, weather and ice claimed many ships, many lives. The arctic is friendly only to those not in it. In 1922, those who were learned to be more respectful.

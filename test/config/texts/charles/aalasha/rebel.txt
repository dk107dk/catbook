Aalasha tried keys in time to her inner voice's sing-song rhyme. The keys were on a string. Earlier that morning she had taken the string from the factory when no one was looking. Since then, she had been sneaking around the storerooms, lofts, office closets, basement, and such matching keys to hidden spaces. She was looking for a makeup kit.

Aalasha was pretty sure her mum had disappeared it sometime in the past week. Aalunae was not accommodating to girlish trinkets, showy fashions, or any part of the universe of feminine fantasy. Aalasha had run up against that prejudice before. As she entered her teens, increasingly often.

Aalasha thought her mum intolerant and overbearing. There wasn't a confrontation. Her mum wasn't that way. And simply throwing it out would she would see as wasteful. Moreover, that wouldn't allow for Aalunae to offhandedly say |Oh, it has to be somewhere| if Aalasha asked directly. On the other hand, for Aalunae to surreptitiously hide the makeup seemed right inline.

The kit had come into Aalasha's possession, briefly, a few weeks earlier. It was her fourteenth birthday. Auntie Martine, who wasn't a real aunt, handed her the present in the factory kitchen before school. She had laughed and flipped her hair back as if remembering something. The package was done up in simple red tissue. Inside, a slightly worn silk and papier-mâché box. Floral print. Shellac. Tiny brass clasp. The box contained small tubes, sticks, and circular containers. Names that meant nothing to Aalasha: Mondaine, Max Factor, Potter and Moore.

Martine and another kitchen employee, Jessia Wilson, took Aalasha in the back washroom and showed her base, rouge, and eyeliner. Laughter, squeals, gasps. She was late to school. Some of the attention she got when she arrived was uncharacteristically welcome. A public upbraiding for her tardy and, according to Ms Bennet, tawdry appearance was not. That night on Low Fellside there had been words. The makeup kit didn't disappear immediately. It was soon gone. As was Jessia, soon after. The connection was never explicit. Martine rarely spoke to Aalasha after that day. Aalasha drew assumptions, as she assumed she was meant to.

The old chests and crates were military or expeditionary or some such. Dusty green, gray, black. Light from ventilation slats. Ceiling rough with splinters and microscopic sap runs tangled in spider webs. Damp. The hum of the factory fainter than the wind. Aalasha played towers of Hanoi with the boxes and knickknacks. The boxes were heavy.

At the back, a four and a half foot dark wood chest with a heavy steel padlock. Three feet deep and two high. Huge! Iron hinges, rivets, and corners. It took all Aalasha's strength to pull it out where she could work on it. It was notably not dusty. She had a feeling. The chest refused her keys. In Aalasha's mind, a good sign. If this wasn't it, it was at least fascinating.

Now, however, Aalasha had a new problem. She had reversed things. She had a box, now she needed to find a key. This problem was equally well suited to her. Over the following several weeks Aalasha rifled easily accessible drawers and pegboards. She infiltrated Charles's workshop and the factory's few crammed offices. She found pretexts to borrow keys only in order to steal other keys from their key rings. She swept under furniture long undisturbed, dusted top shelves, and spring-cleaned couches and rugs. Increasingly she explored private spaces requiring stealth and great care. Slowly she gathered keys.

Eventually one of them fit.

When the box opened it surprised her. The contents were not what Aalasha expected. Though exactly what she had expected she couldn't have said. She wasn't triumphant, though the kit lay there right on top, waiting for her. Aalasha sat back and realized things. Memories flooded back.

The box was divided roughly in half. Slowly Aalasha unpacked each. On the left, frilly ribbons and lacy dresses sent by rarely seen relations. Christmas dolls. A tiara and wand. Mythical stuffed animals. A doll's tea service. Grimms, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Andersen. Bangles and feathers. Aalasha gently wound a cheap child's music box to hear its soft cloying notes, long lost. How did they find their way to the attic? The forbidden chest was where all of Low Fellside's missing fairy tales were buried in the dark.

Then she turned to the right hand side. It was less orderly. A tangle of seal boots, knives, and bead strings. Barometer, compass, and tarnished sextant. A steel flask wrapped in rough skin. Ragged signal flags. Worn ice axe. Battered snowshoes. A leather-strapped bone carved into an outlaw's mask. Books of Shackleton, Bagshawe, Stefansson, and Amundsen. Newspapers and maps.

A manifestations of boreal dreams and nightmares. Relics embodying Charles's scars and memories condensed into one deep pool of Aalunae's fear of his wanderlust. Do totems have the power to trigger unwanted actions? If they are seen day in, day out? Possibly.

Aalasha could well imagine how the chest slowly filled over the years. So slowly, so as not to disturb memories that were slowly settling. Her own memories of missing toys, books, and trinkets. Her dad's memories of dangerous adventures. Things go missing from English houses all the time. Such is life. None of the exotic arctic artifacts were familiar to her. She supposed that was to the point. She wondered if there were more such boxes hidden away.

After many minutes stillness, Aalasha methodically replaced the contents. She shut the chest and extracted the key. She pushed it back under the dim eves. Replaced the boxes around it. Turned and climbed down from the attic.

She never spoke of it. That spring Aalasha planted lavender. She harvested it and mixed her own eyeshadow. The way she saw it, her field, while small, would never fit in that dark box.

Six months after Charles's death his postcard to Aalasha was fixed to a mirror in Aalasha's suite. There were other mementos around it. An old photo of Luna and Bora on the fells. A wrinkled first class liner ticket to the States. Glass flowers. Beads. Bits of knotted string. The usual assorted knick-knacks.

Grim faced, Roseafey had touched most of these objects before giving her attention to the postcard. She wore dusting gloves. Ostrich feather duster slid under the buckle of her pinafore where a long-handled gun might have tucked were she somewhere more interesting than Motherwell. Her stance was quite unlike others in service at Dalzell House.

Examining the postcard, she forgot her bandoleer was pink. Her eyes widened for the first time in days.

Then, a flash of amber rifled down the mirror bevel. Her skin crawled, suddenly cold. Without warning she was choking, airless. A surge of intraocular pressure cascaded back to hammer into her brainstem. She staggered. Was she having a stroke? Her gut erupted. It felt like the migraine-blast of a megawatt-class emerald laser to the face. She doubled over and threw up explosively.

Roseafey had no experience with with this kind of trauma. She could barely crawl down the hall to a bathroom. Gastric wretch, bile, and gray mucus flowed. And yet she was made of sterner stuff than most. After several gasping minutes of cold water and soap she could see well enough to stagger off the premises, moving as fast as she could. Eyes black-spotted. Face burned and contorted. A phone. Klade must know! If only she could remain upright that long.

In her pocket, frightening evidence: a card stock square mounted behind the postcard. It held a fragment of Charles's diary in code. And beside that, a passport-sized photo of Roseafey's own face, no doubt sourced from the temp agency Klade had placed her in.

A few minutes later Aalasha entered the House through a small, heavy iron door built into the lowest terrace of the four garden platforms. The door was thirty-five feet below where most people assumed the foundations of the house lay. Aalasha assumed Rees knew of it. She felt the Grounds Keeper should also know, at least of the door, and he probably did. It was, however, entirely possible that she had the only key.

Behind the door was a narrow unlit corridor with a mortared flagstone surface. The walls were fortress-scale ashlar blocks, damp with moisture. She felt her way to set of shelves built into the wall and found a flashlight. Along this corridor were portcullis grooves, ventilation shafts, murder holes, ring bolts, and other appurtenances of defense. And more iron-bound doors. Keys for at least some of them must have been somewhere. Are keys accountable for what happens in chambers with unspeakable histories?

There were two descents into the lowest and most ancient castle platform that she knew of. The two sections did not connect. Corridors had been walled off. Locks and bars were common. Passageways and steps ran into what appeared to be unhewn rock. It was impossible to know what tunnels and rooms lay between. It was said that Dalzell House incorporated the ruins of four previous fortifications. Aalasha believed it.

Each section had a single elaborately worked exterior exit. Presumably these were sortie and escape routes. Around these soft and deadly orifices the architectural shell was massive, paranoid, and well hidden. Aalasha had taken pains to keep the castle's deepest secrets out of sight of her children. She assumed they knew of the exterior doors. Regular careful inspection of a dusty environment said they had never penetrated the full depths that lay behind them.

Aalasha hurried upward. A few minutes earlier she had seen a maid stumbling frantically from the back of the northern courtyard past the nursery up the lane to the main road. Kathryn Kelly, in severe distress. Pulling off her jumper as she went. It was full flight. That meant one of a very few things. Not theft. The exit was too abrupt and not stealthy. Someone was dead or someone soon would be or the one who was running was afraid for her life. These possibilities were not mutually exclusive.

Aalasha knew the maid's name, though it was no doubt an alias. She had been watching her for days. In a few minutes Aalasha would know if the maid had found what she had left for her to find. If she had found it, it was barely even odds she would survive the day. Either way, the point was proven. The next step would be taken post haste. A poisonous bile was rising fast.

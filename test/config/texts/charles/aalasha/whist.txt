The light filtering through the tall narrow windows of the Anambas Islands Suite was tangible in the way that only well-maintained upper floor furnished rooms in keeps unused for years can manage. The typical large four-poster bed, dressers, and such had been packed away. In place, drawing room decor. A blurry |ikat| carpet lay loosely on the floor. Points reflected from silver and mirrors slipped about the weaves covering the stone walls. The quiet was calming.

In the center, a midsize laburnum tripod table inlaid with warm tones of satin birch. It had been made in Perthshire by a woodworker whose family was said to have been vassals of the Earl of Carnwath, a late Lord Dalzell and Liberton. The top of its pedestal legs had more recently been sheaved in wrought tin leaves, adding to the sparks dappling the dusty air. A glass surface floated over delicate lace. And on that rested the purse, trump, and tricks of a hand of whist in flight.

Four women surrounded the table. One leaned in. One sat attentively. One leaned back. And one lolled in a careless and showy malaise. They were dressed of periods and manners. It was clear who was most comfortable in the noble environs, vis-a-vis who not so innately at ease. Their dress was reasonably fit for an afternoon tea. In most cases, it was not that of a place where ladies were likely to engage in serious gambling at whist. Nevertheless, that is what occupied them.

The woman leaning in wore white. She was drawn. Pretty. Pale and serious. Her eyes, moist. Wearing a shawl looped over hair that was thin and almost light enough to look a shade old. Despite that, she was not. Her hand was covered as if she had concerns about her partners. And she was eager. Each card revealed the future. She was enthralled by what it might bring. Breathless, even, for every minute after the next to arrive. She played the queen of hearts with a rapid hand motion.

To her right, a crisp dress with a high neck supported a comfortably stiff posture. The lady in perse gray was finished and accomplished, though not highborn. Around her neck she wore a pince-nez on a loop of pewter chain. It was not clear she needed the assistance of anyone, let alone glasses. More likely she was to offer assistance to others. Her smart attire was simple, but of quality cloth. While not wearing a work outfit, she looked the part of a nurse or aide. She was young, poised, and seemed likely to be hiding a skeptical face. She played the three of hearts carefully. Did she intentionally underplay her hand? It was not unthinkable.

The turn passed to a woman in diaphanous silks of a verdant design evoking the swaying papyrus of the Upper Nile, where the current slows and widens into the grand mildness of the great lakes. She was three sheets to the wind. Her drink was absynthe, of course. The matte and transparent greens of her loose dress were offset by numerous thin rings and bangles. Moss agate, silver, Colombian emerald, and jade. They jingled softly as she settled. Theatrical was not doing her justice. After fiddling, she played a losing Jack of hearts with a sigh.

Across from their half-circle, leaning back with an amused, if tight-lipped, expression, was the Lady Dalzell, in a deep blue gown carrying the formal, even severe, decorum befitting Scottish nobility personified, if only by distant acclamation â€“ Aalasha Tanine. She played the ace of hearts with honors. Fathering her cards face down, she reached for the absynthe. She refilled the glass of the Green Lady.

Having won the hand, Aalasha proceeded to ask the one question she was due. She looked at her partners and they at her. She proceeded to speak in her way without speaking to three souls who were themselves long past it.

"My sisters, my question is this: My infernal husband and his devious abettor have wronged my family in a mortal sin. Your previous advice has been borne out. No exculpation is possible. The debt must be paid directly, and deftly done, such that we are no more disquieted by these cankerworm wretches.

She paused. Assessed the ladies' attentiveness, and continued.

"Now then, what is your advice as to the resolution to our problem?

The Green Lady's mouth turned upward in a mischievous scowl. Her eyes narrowed dangerously. The face of the scorned ready to rip into the scorner.

Plants are far more interesting then most people realize. They are deadline-driven profit maximizers. A plant reallocates resources ruthlessly to adapt to changing conditions. It applies stochastic functions to fully explore parameterized spaces. And it fluidly employs cooperative or competitive tactics to gain an existential advantage in markets seeking dynamical equilibrium. Mac was more like a plant than he would ever have admitted, had anyone thought to ask him. Aalasha had long before concluded Mac was below the level of most plants, and so wouldn't have bothered to ask.

Aalasha had an innate sense for the balance of root to shoot. She had quickly been impressed by the need for her to fully explore and control her environment. Dalzell House was complicated. It contained six levels above ground. Below ground, two more well-known floors. However, below those two known floors hid more levels of ancient works. Below the datum Dalzell House was deep, dark, and increasingly small and dangerous as you descended.

That isn't to say all was benign above the fold, either. Far from it. Children could run into difficulties in so many ways. There were spiral stairs, latching cupboards, hidden rooms, dangerous holes explained and unexplained, and pointy unknown medieval hardware. Lead in pipes, lead in paint, lead in stained glass solder. These, among a million other unaccommodating sharp edges of castle life.

More than these, though, were her concerns about the people a child might meet. It would be a disaster for one of the children to be heard in a hidden passage behind Mac's office. By the time Aalasha was worried about Paul's whereabouts, she was far more concerned by the latter then by the asbestos tiles in the large kitchen or the non-zero probability of an iron maiden lurking in the vaults below. Large unpredictable things that moved under their own power and had fierce tempers were the major concern.

In the balance of roots and shoots there was the pull of the nutrients available and the push of the predator. Were aggressions unchecked above? Fine, she would spend time learning the roots below. Were there times of quiet light and gentle rain. Well then, she would send out shoots above. In this way, her investigations followed cycles within cycles. Seasonal, diurnal, the business week, the business cycle. And within these, the slow rhythm of fractal root and branch exploration into every tiniest corner that might house even the smallest threat to her newborn seedlings.

It was in this way that Aalasha discovered the hidden wall safe in Puerto Villamil. She had been younger then. Only beginning to wonder why her future seemed likely to be constrained to the brute walls of a Scottish redoubt. How had she mistakenly imagined the castle was a romantic fairytale reified? Nevertheless, it was as it was. She took comfort in the several brightly decorated islands suites scattered among the floors. Aalasha would lay on the four-posters and stare at tapestries of warmer sunlit hills over tropical beaches.

And at the same time, she would explore each room with a critical eye. She found keys behind dressers, bell pulls within columns, speaking tubes to somewhere, secret passages to nowhere, cupboards within cupboards, and, in one case, a safe. The safe was hidden behind panels themselves covered by a Henry Raeburn portrait. While it didn't fit with the island decor, the painting dissuaded the close examination that would have been required to find the lockbox. When she discovered it, she found it unlatched with a key inside. Some keys hide secrets, some secrets hide keys.

That key Aalasha added to a large ring of keys. Her third such ring. As with Rees and the children, Aalasha collected Dalzell's keys voraciously. Unlike the children, she could require Rees to make duplicates of any she found or requested. In the case of the safe, she saw no reason to turn the key in. What she didn't know was that Rees knew of the safe and had his own key. How came it to be that he hadn't had possession of both keys Rees couldn't have said. It had been years ago. Perhaps he never knew there were two?

Regardless, Klade requested Rees situate him in a suite that offered a secure workspace and Rees thought of Puerto Villamil first. When Rees showed him the safe Klade was appreciative. On his moving in, Rees gave him the key. Not remembering the second key, had he even ever known of it, he quite honestly gave Klade to understand that his was the only key in existence. It was a reasonable position to take.

In turn, Klade entrusted the small safe for several important artifacts. Among these, a journal and sundry papers. Later joined by much more such, some encoded. He was right to hide them. They were the very definition of sensitive.

"
Aalasha had more than the usual complement of senses. And her's were the other definition of sensitive. She felt the geometry of people and spaces. The electric aura of atmospheric disturbance. The people who blocked the light and stole the rain. When Roseafey joined Rees's staff on a temporary assignment she used the name Kathryn Kelly. She was thinking of Machine Gun Kelly. Of course she was. That attitude, and every other thing about her, was a demeanor that wasn't especially hard to sense.

Aalasha quickly got wind. She always met new staff, at least cursorily. It was immediately apparent, Kathryn was wrong. Was it her accent? Perhaps her muscular stance? Undoubtedly her unusual blend of superciliousness and insouciance would be all but impossible to hide from Aalasha. Every tiny motion would tell something. Every hormonal signal would scream. Still, when you find supple death in your space staring you down you don't concern yourself if it's a cougar or a jaguar. No, you grab a chair and wonder who the hell put a cat on you.

Aalasha wasn't cowed in the least. In fact, this invasion was an interesting puzzle. The children were gone. The nights were long. She needed something to do. If things got fractious, well, that would be much better than boredom. As well, it might possibly offer a clue as to what chicanery connected Dalzell House to Fellfall Farm.

In this attitude, Aalasha and Roseafey had more in common then they might have imagined. With her ill-concealed feline dangerousness, Aalasha rated Kathryn more plant-like than she would have given Mac credit for. Entirely not wrong, despite being a funny way of thinking. Regardless, that assessment would not save Roseafey, should Aalasha take offense. Perceived or not by her, Roseafey was prowling about on dangerous ground.

And because her ground was being scouted, Aalasha increased her own parameter scrutiny. There were three possibilities. Kathryn was a tool of Mac's. Or she was Klade's. Or there was something more concerning and less tractable, even, about the business. If Mac were the root of it all, he would very likely work through Klade. If it were an even more mysterious force, Klade might well still know something. So, it was to Klade.

As it turned out, Klade was on Aalasha's third keyring.

This process of analysis, decision, key-finding, and surreptitious action took a trivial amount of thought, only a very little more actual effort. That effort brought her rapidly to the Puerto Villamil Suite's hidden safe on an afternoon she felt sure she would not be disturbed. Klade was in Glasgow. The staff were at a low ebb before an informal evening meal. Rooms were clean. Clocks were wound. The house was silent.

She would long remember the moment she opened the safe. A few papers loosely stacked. A silk sheaved chinoiserie box containing a pair of gold-inlaid steel baoding balls. And a number of thick, black notebooks. She knew whose writing she was looking at immediately. The first she picked up was coded with a strangely familiar cypher. The second one, incomprehensible. The third notebook in the stack began:

|    My dearest Lasha

As she read, anyone who spoke the private language of Aalasha would have left the room hurriedly and gotten as far away, as quickly as possible. As it happened, no one was about and she had plenty of time to read. By the time she left the room the future had changed considerably. For some, considerably for the worse.

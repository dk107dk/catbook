"Who are you?

The little girl communicated her question not daring to make a sound.

"        My father is the Ice King. His voice rings louder than Barrow Bells.
"        My mother is a giantess. Her bones sleep deep under the fells.
"        I am the Emerald Princess, goddess of this tarn.

The face in the rippled water smiled. Her halo was of gold and green. She tossed her braided willow hair and shook her mossy sleeves. She smiled at the girl with a young bream's quickness. Iridescent dragonflies stopped to stare.

"So, now you know, little girl â€“ who am I. The question is, who are you?

The girl stood by the lake in a clearing below a moorish rise. She scratched her nose and considered. Noxious basket by her side: cow-wheat, saffron, hemlock, and stinging nettle. She dipped a tin cup in the water. Shredded leaves and flowers. She proceeded to make tea for her highborn new acquaintance.

"Come sit on the bank with me. I will serve us tea. We will play a game.

The Emerald Princess of the tarn shook her locks in the breeze and laughed. Not unkindly. She was delighted, she said. She would play. Perhaps they would become friends.

"It is a counting game. We will count birds and fish and bumblebees. And leaves and clouds and shadows. Whoever counts more wins.

The Emerald Princess saw her chance. A chance to learn of the human world far from her lake. Towns, trucks, electric lights, and trains. A world as wondrous to her as her world was wondrous in the eyes of her young companion.

"Very well, little one. And whoever shall win the round may ask the other a question. And whatever the question be, the answerer must answer true, come what may.

The Emerald Princess looked forward to asking many questions.

Aalasha looked forward to winning the game. She poured the tea. They began to play.

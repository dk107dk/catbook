Aalasha expressed a strong preference for the warmth of the Ile Mahé suite. Its balmy pre-Victorian skies teemed under a tropical sun filtered through morning haze. The French warship |Chiffonne| peeked around a verdant promontory. She was particularly fond of the suite for its possibly intentional pun: the wall mural's ship was framed in gauzy silk noil patterned with pressed leaves of wild vanilla, cinnamon, and dragon's blood.

The nurse Mac selected had other ideas. And the midwife the nurse insisted on concurred: Aalasha would lie-in in the Victoria apartment. Those smaller rooms were convenient to a kitchen and more modern toilet facilities. An obstetrician would be on call, at the ready. Aalasha protested. It did no good. The cold castle held numerous cold rooms. She would give birth in one of them.

Mac was conspicuous by his frequent absences. From afar he sent caring notes with distant formality. When briefly present, he was all empty expressions, pablum accommodations, and the emission of directions sans involvement. He expressed concern when it was right to show concern. He did it efficiently between other concerns.

And then one day, at the end of her first trimester, with the morning sickness greatly faded, Mac brought news. He delivered it by turns coolly, then with fervor. Tanine Holdings was to make a foray in a strategic direction that was wholly new. There was to be a new addition to its industrial family.

Mac kept it high level. In essence, a partnership had been formulated between Holding and a player in the American automotive parts industry, Textron, a rising conglomeration. The prospective partners intended to acquire three suppliers to General Motors' Framingham Assembly, in Massachusetts, one of the largest automobile works in the States, and therefore in the world. GM had tentatively blessed the merger and would take a ten percent share. A new factory would be raised. Commerce quickened. Tanine's reach extended across the stormy Atlantic into the heart of the American industrial powerhouse. It was to be, Mac declaimed, a new beginning.

Left unsaid, though clearly foreshadowed, Mac was about to shortly become even more busy than the chairman of innumerable boards had already been. Time overseas in the States was a certainty. Likely a lot of it. Aalasha wondered as he rattled on. What was she meant to take away from all this? For certain something. She felt almost as invisible as the enumerable ghosts of Ladies Dalzell past. Their eyes followed her.

By this time, clearly showing and occasionally quite uncomfortable, Aalasha had managed to excuse herself from many ceremonial duties. Her days became quiet as her child quietly grew. From Mac's vantage, she was a trophy to display. One that had of late become badly tarnished. Oh, no doubt she would again become the soignée form riding her man's arm at tony affairs. And yet, at best a cherishing mother encumbered, no longer a shooting star.

Soon enough, it was impossible for Aalasha to avoid the fact: she had lost her position as the princess consort. Moreover, Aalasha had to confront something she had suppressed for quite some time. Not only was she was most often alone, she was increasingly lonely.

The extroversion of everyone is specific. Aalasha was buried in a dark castle at the dead of winter in a body that was no longer quite hers. She was far from communion with her flowers, creepers, and heather fields. No mosses gathered. No ferns unfurled. Kendall's fells were too far away for her to feel. A thick bleached cotton batting of melancholy muffled her, trapped within her husband's inanimate world.

Dawn broke most often misty over the valley below. One February day, the mist swarmed. It surged across the Clyde. It drowned the liverworts encroaching Dalzell Burn. It filtered a land fractured by extraction into a mystical dimness, the like of the landscapes of Horatio McCulloch and Jacob More hung along the Gallery Hall, a part of the house Mac was never seen in. And as a new day waxed, the damp air laid siege to Aalasha's ill rested eyes.

"Am I cast off or made free? Is this a life I want to keep?

Aalasha spoke unintentionally, though without a sound. Unintentionally, fragments of half told stories tickled at the edge of her mind. Her mother's lonely vigil. A pregnancy lost at the time of her father's last, lost expedition. Whispers of the disappearance and reappearance of kitchen hands. There are things a girl comes to know that no adult ever says.

"My dear the question is, who are you?

The face in the rippled window pane smiled so very slightly. Her silken halo was a rich forest green. Silver and jade in the soft light shimmered. One eyebrow rose, urging Aalasha's answer.

"        My mother's bones are marlstone, with mica for her eyes.
"        My father sings the hoarfrost to draw winter from the sky.
"        I am the Earthen Goddess, ruler of this clough.

The rippled face laughed empathetically through the mist. Her hazel eyes batted as they met Aalasha's. She leaned close to whisper.

"So, now you know, little girl – who are you. The question is, who will you become?

Their foreheads touched.

"I'm so alone.

The glass was cold. The walls pressed down. The indifferent Clyde flowed wide. The woman in shivering silk leaned close. Her reflection glowed emerald against the gray sky. The whisper in Aalasha's ear was barely audible.

"We are so much stronger than that. You and I.

>1919 - Charles and Aalunae build a life in Kendal

The Chesterians owned a good piece of land about a mile by road from their house in the village on Low Fellside. Little more than half a mile by footpath. A quarter of the land was given over to the cultivation of mint. The rest was let out for hay. A local man paid a modest rent for the privilege.

Over the years Charles steadily expanded the land by purchasing adjacent fields when they became available. His goal was to allow the family to eventually grow enough mint for the factory. In the meantime, they were learning the crop and how to render it to mint oil at scale. It was a long-term project. The rental income wasn't enough to make them rentiers. Every little bit helped, though.

When he first bought the land Charles was infatuated with it. It was the first thing of any permanence and size he had ever owned. Other than the considerable exceptions of his marriage and his Navy career, he felt it was the first thing he had done in life where he took the main chance.

He had put something of value on the line: his mobility. Land had to be tended. It was illiquid. Its fruits were years in the future. And very possibly it would be more trouble than it was worth. He could choose to go walkabout again, following his inner compass north. But he couldn't take land with him. It had to be minded.

Charles felt encumbered. Yet, at the same time, he was landed. A man of substance. And not just by marriage. The land represented prospects. And in turn, he paid it mind, improved it, and knew every inch. Every unusual aspect. The tattered bag of farthings he unearthed in the far corner. The slight depressions that he felt sure were graves. The areas where the soil ran red with decayed timber. All of it.

A few years after she and Charles married, Aalunae's parents declined to the point they had to relinquish running the business to their daughter. Charles had put in the little money he had and his pension. And he put in a lot of sweat equity working alongside Aalunae. He became a full partner in Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cakes.

Charles's best contribution was on the finance and distribution sides. He ran the numbers and made runs for the wire. Following the family's longstanding tradition, Charles also rolled up his sleeves and learned the vats, presses, and ovens. Aalunae provided day-to-day management. Charles' contacts in exploration and military circles were fruitful. The business grew slowly, but it grew.

Aalunae had always had side projects. Soap. Weaving. Tool smithing. And her so-called apothecary garden. She grew an esoteric mix of remedies, prophylactics, and additives. As far as anyone knew, she had no clientele. Beyond herself, of course.

When the Chesterians acquired the additional fields Aalunae expanded her tiny garden. It had occupied one corner of the mint plot. After the move Aalunae built a sturdy rabbit fence with a little gate. A dirt path also helped separate the garden from the mint and the hayfields.

At the time, she had joked that she was expanding the apothecary garden into a full-service poison garden. No one who heard that made anything of it. In private Aalunae was given to darkly humorous comments that were inapposite for one whose products needs be unimpeachable. Charles noted that she was scrupulous about separating her plants from the rest of the land. He did not concern himself.

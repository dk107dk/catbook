>1922 - Aalasha is born in Kendal

First considered a breeze, the rescue freshened into a gale-force blow.

Charles met the |Teddy Bear| in Nome. He sized her up as a low-tonnage, tight-berth, worn down schooner. It was clear that she was well-built for purpose only by means of ingenious retrofit and constant repair. For the job at hand, |Teddy Bear| was the inverse of extravagant. Charles was not surprised Stefansson had again cut to the bone. Though, on careful inspection, it seemed |Teddy Bear| might do.

Her captain, Joe Bernard, was an successful arctic trader and imaginatively resourceful ice master. Success in the context of Bernard was defined particularly. He was prematurely grizzled by numerous arctic shipwrecks, more ice-drift miles than literally anyone, and dozens of years of living off the land stranded north of the seventy-first parallel. His career lent itself to death notices. They had been printed in the lower forty-eight repeatedly. To that point, none verified. All that experience and luck seemed to make up for a lot.

Almost one hundred miles due east of Wrangel |Teddy Bear's| luck ran out. She iced-in solid. Conditions were unexpectedly bad for August. The small crew of Europeans and Eskimos drifted for more than two months. They ran dangerously low on food. Passing well north of Wrangel, they continued inexorably west.

Eventually, in this instance, the devil ice slipped under the waves before the ship did. |Teddy Bear| was able to limp towards home, shipping water through the threatening dark, in abject failure. A three-week extraction turned into more than four months of hardship. Still, no one had died. At least on the ship.

The shore party was another matter. All four men died badly. It was another year before Stefansson could mount a successful rescue mission. Success was defined down to be reaching the island and extracting a life. The sole survivor, Ada Blackjack, a terrified Inuit woman, fought off insanity. Her's is a terrible, fractured story, but it is not this one.

Charles was badly shaken by yet another serious hardship. His health and mental toughness were not as robust as he had wished. He was not the man he was in 1914. His frame shook in the wind at the bow as he willed the |Teddy Bear| forward to Nome. Her landing was subdued and exhausted. Charles felt more than ready to retire to Cumbria for good. However, rock bottom was still waiting for him on Nome Beach.

Heartbreakingly, Aalunae had lost her pregnancy in the second trimester. The cables were brief and clinical. Charles received them as he stepped on the boardwalk. The newly installed Port Officer was stony-faced. He turned away.

Charles immediately grasped the trauma he had missed. He lost it. Screamed in despair. Shattered his fourth and fifth metacarpals repeatedly punching a frozen seawall piling. Dropped to his knees and slammed his forehead into the gravel. It was good Stefansson was not in Nome that morning. Charles left Nome that night, broken.

"
Charles arrived back in Kendal still stricken. He still suffered the after-effects of extensive frostbite and caloric restriction. Aalunae had been conciliatory. How could he have known she was with child, given her telegrams had not reached him till he was back in Nome? Still, it had rocked them both. And it took Charles much commitment to her, their home, their small business, and the village life before they were ready to try again.

Aalasha Martine Chesterian was born in the evening. Conveniently, she came after the factory shut and dinner was washed up. An easy birth, as was typical for the matriline. Unlike her reticent parents, even on arrival, Aalasha had a lot to say.

Aalunae convalesced quickly. Before anyone expected, she was again directing the factory kitchen and harvesting mint. Indeed, that June she replanted much of her garden with geometric precision. Her other hobbies, soaps and oils for local sale, followed swiftly after. Aalasha was much of the time on her mother's back or hip.

Aalasha grew quickly, as healthy children do. Her upbringing was unusual. Aalunae taught her the art of making. The talent for ideating and constructing from whatever odds and ends were available. Bits and pieces, found materials, repurposed equipment, fixed-up junk, and such. Aalasha constructed, cooked, poured, and formed goods for profitable sale at an age when her peers were playing with dolls or clumsily planting seeds in window boxes.

Her father taught her about engines, pumps, and irrigation. He taught her how to keep the books and purchase equipment from faraway catalogs. Aalasha saw magic everywhere. Most especially in how she could seal an envelope with a kiss, slip it into a brass slot, and in a few weeks find it transformed into a box, pallet, or sack.

Her nanny taught her Flemish, French, and a rough and rebellious Basque. Her grandfather taught her slates for roofs, limestone for fertilizer, and coal for the company stoves. Her grandmother taught her piano at the local church on Sundays. For reasons of the care they took and the love they gave, Aalasha took to her elders' teachings. By school age, she was well beyond mere grammar school.

Aalasha was vivacious, willful, and occasionally caustic. Sun and clouds. The nurturing watering can versus a slashing sickle. As with her mother at a young age, only more so. Aalunae and Charles hoped she would grow towards the sun.

A stubborn streak emerged from her talent for rapt attention. A reader from a young age, she was likely to do it hanging from her knees in a tree. Mainly to see how long she could last with her temples pounding. What did she read? |The Trees, Shrubs, and Plants of Virgil| and |Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-bee| were favorites. Bees danced in trees. Why shouldn't she? |Because of this, why shouldn't I do that?| became her obstreperous calling card.

As she watched the grown-ups around her, she spent less and less time talking. In her house, talk was only intermittently reciprocated. Rather than the stoical quiet of Charles, she took after Aalunae. She conveyed much with tics, motions, and posture. Creative glossology was in character for Fellsman women. The older generations were gruffly charmed. They encouraged her high bandwidth communication. When Aalasha was in the room people talked less and laughed more. At least on the good days.

Somewhere in her hortensial preteens Aalasha began regularly accompanying her mother to the poison garden. She watched and tended. She learned to identify plants, their properties, their predators, and how to craft the next generation to be bigger, stronger, and richer. She learned to cut, dry, extract, and powder. She learned to measure, mix, taint, and dissolve.

Aalunae showed her the many ways to deliver a dose of a preparation. However, conspicuously Aalunae did not instruct Aalasha who and when to dose with what. By Aalunae's conscious intention or not, Aalasha grew in her understanding of biologics in a garden of amorality that nurtured a curious lack of constraint and contextualization.

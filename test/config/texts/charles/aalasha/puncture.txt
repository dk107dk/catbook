Aalasha hadn't kept much from her childhood. Growing up, she had created so voraciously there was no time for looking back. And, in the scrape-penny industriousness of the rural petit bourgeois, scrappage was the main source of new works. Her old treasures were therefore few. Her small treasure box, plenty large enough. She opened it on a rainy afternoon in her home, Dalzell House. An afternoon when everything was bad.

In the box, lay a silver broach. A goddess's head with hair full of flowers. It had been a gift to smooth over a rough patch.

"
Five years before that day, Aalasha had come downstairs at the family's house on Low Fellside. She observed Aalunae scrubbing the kitchen raw. That, after she had already nosily had her way with the factory. Her vehemence was notable to anyone. Face strained. Hands cut and pruned. Jaw clenched. A good plate broken. The copper dust pan bent.

The night prior, Mac had driven Aalasha down from Glasgow. He drove the two of them himself on the theory that a larger car with a driver would send the wrong signals in rural post-war Kendal. So then, the bright blue Lagonda 2.6 litre drophead coupé, heavy on chrome and leather, and fit for high speed. It sent the village what? Certainly not the |right| signals.

The Lady Aalasha wore silks and bangles that blew behind the windshield. Her knight, serious tailoring that did not. The couple arrived as expected at six p.m. for dinner at Charles's interpretation of Aalasha's request for "the best restaurant in Kendal". The dinning room at The Wild Boar. Mac took rooms at the Wren Estate's hunting lodge, nearby. Aalasha was to return to her parent's home for the night.

The Boar's dining room was low and warm. Plaster, post, beam. A roaring fieldstone hearth. Irons. Low lights, candles, kerosene. In the first wrinkle, the party was mistaken for one much larger. Two parents, an aunt and uncle, in addition to the betrothed, did not a party of twelve make. The private room's long table was uncomfortably empty. Soon enough they were reseated at a pair of joined tables in a window nook of the main room. Problem solved.

The seating plan fell out of an awkward angloise the company danced between door and table. It involved warm words, handshakes, slight bows, and an abortive shoulder slap that quietly schooled Mac that Charlies wasn't a casual touch. The men clustered at one end. They would build relationships. As the prospective groom was an unknown, Aalunae positioned herself across. This left Aalasha at the other end from Charles, between aunt and uncle. She leaned in and spoke loudly. It didn't work. She was largely stuck in a conversation she could have had at ten years-old.

The tables were cozy. Too much so. Charles was not a small man. Aalasha's maternal uncle Josiah Reaver, likewise. And Mac Tanine was flat out large. He stooped passing under the beams. His knees knocked the table. It was tight. Mac was left handed. Sitting at a small table to the right of Josiah, with Charles on his right at the head, was a tactical blunder. Such happens in dinners without servants. Short of taking the head of the table, there wasn't much better. Mac soon felt pinned. He was too Scottish to completely not show it.

Josiah's seat was an unfortunate choice for another reason. He was in senior leadership at the Vickers Naval Yard in nearby Furness. Vickers and the surrounding industrial landscape was to English shipbuilding as Glasgow's Clydeside was to Scotland's. Soon enough, Mac uncovered Josiah's affiliations.

While Tanine Holdings had significant stakes in shipbuilding on the Clyde, that wasn't the thing thing that rocked Mac back. Rather, it was Barrow Ironworks Limited, source of the steel that built English shipping, stern and keel. The ironworks was cross-owned and not many years past being the largest steel mill in the world. As a tightly bound pair, they were deadly competitors to Robert Tanine. Mac was under no illusion his father wouldn't suss out the connection. How he would react was hard to foresee.

"In these unsettled times industry is challenged at home and abroad.

Mac was feeling his conversational way through an evening that was of mixed parts: |ante facto| engagement celebration, the striking up of a countryside friendship amongst couples newly acquainted, and a meeting of industrial insiders. Only the last was truly comfortable ground for him.

Charles was attempting to be sociable. It was hard to see.

"Cottage industry was always a duffer. Cities may be different, but here we tend to buy high and sell low. Pass the bread.

Josiah tried to draw Mac out.

"Tell us about your work in the family business.

A "family business" is not at all what Robert and Mac would have people call Tanine Holdings.

"As you know, Tanine is a conglomerate. The holding company is active in numerous sectors centered on heavy industry. We are the northern locus of coal, glass, ores, and, particularly, steel.

Charles was busy with his roast beef. Josiah took the opportunity for his steak. Mac declaimed.

"Until this year, I could have said we built, ran, or had controlling positions in the primer British steel works: Dalzell, Clyde Iron Works, Lanarkshire Steel, and Ravenscraig.

Josiah's face didn't light up. He didn't smile, exactly. Yet Mac clearly saw something he didn't appreciate. Something potentially needling. On the other hand, perhaps he was reading too much in?

"Historically, so. From that base, Holding took substantial minorities in construction, engineered materials, automobiles, and your shipbuilding industry. Along with in some cases, building firms de novo. This of course continues to this day.

Charles continued to work the main course. Josiah engaged.

"Shipbuilding is next, I hear. You chaps in steel just took one for the national team, wouldn't you say? How have the changes been for the company? I would imagine, hard, yes?

The Iron and Steel Act of 1949 had just gone into effect. Opposition, notwithstanding. Mac's corner of dinner had naturally progressed from Josiah tossing one up to Mac to him hiding hints of both schadenfreude and self-interested fear. The Act nationalized the largest steel firms in Britain. Ostensibly to improve output and competition. While it was not out and out expropriation, neither was it wholeheartedly welcomed. Many conservatives and most owners were in an uproar. Mac stiffened.

"We saw it coming. Holding is diversified and, increasingly, financialized.

Charles got a question in while working his sides.

"Financialized?

Mac paused, took wine, and reflected. Generations of Tanines started a process of economic transformation that had anticipated, well, almost everything. His forebears were unlikely to get credit for their astute moves. His choice, in that moment, was to educate.

"We are a stock holding company that owns fractions of a wide range of liquid assets. Including controlling interests in multiple commerce and custodial banks. Whenever money is invested in Scottish heavy industry or industrial equipment, we are there, participating and benefiting. Holding is behind the scenes and everywhere.

Mac's lecture was couched genially. Nonetheless, he could not stop the words, no matter the social circumstances. They tumbled out with gathering enthusiasm and lessening humility.

"So then, the Iron and Steel Act? We were paid handsomely.

Mac and Josiah continued to genteelly joust. Charles continued to have more interest in a meal that wasn't his usual plain fare. Aalasha, at the far head of the table, had a concerned look and distracted contributions to a woman's conversation of little import. She made little use of her food, though her knife got a demonstrative workout.

Aalunae, talked lightly without direction. Without seeming too, she listened closely to the men. She didn't like what she heard. What she heard was a braggard. A lazy one. A man used to others huffing and puffing to no end. One who is accustomed to his conversants finding themselves easily overwhelmed. One whose innate aggression relaxes into an ironic breeze of lackadaisical cruelty. Verbally tearing an acquaintance down seems too light an entertainment. Dynamiting an interlocutor lets them off too easy. The listener's patient disregard was infinite. Mac was unaware he let loose so many clues.

In all, Mac was a dangerous man. Of that she was sure. Given her daughter's sharp edges, an ice storm seemed, to her, all but inevitable. Sooner or later. Aalunae didn't inject herself deeply into the male-dominated dinner conversation. However, in the morning when Aalasha came downstairs, her reaction to Mac was clear: she was having none of it.

"What is the nature of him, then?

Aalasha felt a high wind with the potential for flooding.

"He is sweetness and light. You don't know him. I thought he was a perfect gentleman at dinner. You smiled and laughed. What's wrong with that?

Aalunae was struggling to find the right words.

"He is false. He is not who he says he is. He plays a player's role. He behaves how he believes the leading man should play. He is buying the audience.

Aalasha felt it was the same old argument. New wine, old bottles, or maybe old wine, new bottles? She ran the tap, banged the cupboards, clicked her teeth. Ostensibly looking for cereal. Actually, drowning out a back and forth she didn't want to be party to.

"That's it isn't it, though. You are offended by his money. He doesn't live in the country and work with his hands, so he's not a good man.

Aalunae snapped her cloth. Drops flew.

"That's not it at all and you know it. But maybe you are dazzled by his family's wealth. Castles, cars. Doesn't matter. Deep down you know he isn't your people!

As her mum railed and shook, Aalasha managed to drop a box of Welgars. Shredded wheat biscuits shattered on the flags.

"Whose people? I saw you looking at him at dinner. I was watching you. If he had started acting strangely I'd have known. I know what you do!

In less than sixty seconds a tea cup had shattered on the wall. Lips shook. Aalunae looked up from where she had landed, having slipped on her soapy rag. Bruised, sore. Aalasha, gone. The front door slam still vibrating the windows.

That night Aalasha didn't return. Her bag lay on her bed upstairs. The next morning dawned subdued. Aalunae took the truck round to the dairy and farm. Aalasha arrived on foot shortly after she left, almost as if planned. Mac was nearby in the Lagonda.

On her way downstairs she encountered Charles. Her dad looked older. His hands curled as he came to her. Head low. Voice low.

"She loves you, Lasha. You know that. Right or wrong, she's just trying to protect you.

Aalasha held her arms straight down. Charles reached for her right hand. Lifted it. Held it with both of his. All nine gnarled digits. It was a long moment. Then she kissed his bristly cheek, turned, walked downstairs, and out. In her hand she found a silver broach. An unspoken peace offering.

"
Peace of an overcast, brooding sort preceded formal lunch downstairs in the main dining room of Dalzell House. Aalasha's room's twelve foot ceilings, polished hard woods, and glass reverberated with her tension. Flowers and |pénzāi|. The whole house echoed an atmosphere of impatience. Mac's guests were waiting. Mac would not be present. His consort would have to, yet again, cover for his absence. She was overdue.

The mirror reflected a faint green glow. Aalasha stared out of the emerald aventurescence balefully. Her broach, now toned to a rich reddish black, lay unclasped. She stretched out it's pin. Carefully, she jabbed the scarred pad of her index finger deeply. A tiny rose bloomed, or, she considered, perhaps more trenchantly, the blossom of lycoris radiata, the corpse flower. She sucked it with disgust. Then in a frenzy she stabbed at each of her fingers' distal phalanx. Nine thrusts. Nine times, shooting pain.

When she got to her left ring finger she paused and bit down. Hard. Harder. As if to sever it. Pain, pain pushed away the rain. It focused her and dulled the senses. It distracted her from the day.

Aalasha carefully shredded a tissue to absorb the blood. It would stanch long enough to get the broach pinned to her dress. A ring of bruising formed. Points of blood clotted. She turned away. She walked, erect and proud, down the sweeping stairs to lunch with fools and charlatans. She had nothing to say to them.

Aalasha lived in a fairytale reified. The fairytale had had it sieges. It had its ghosts. Its stones told stories. A new story was emerging. The story of a girl-bride who ran from the countryside to the castle. There, she transformed by turns to captive princess then glowering dark goddess.

Bloody fingerprints were merely one waypoint. It was a long road.

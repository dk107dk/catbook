>1968 - Charles blows Paul's mind in Kendal

The door was heavy. It had a six-inch iron-barred portal, blocked with new hardwood fastened from the inside. The hinges were also on the inside. A thick brass escutcheon and its handle were tarnished to black. Paul knocked and tried the door. He called out for Charles. Nothing. The locked handle had no play. He turned to head up.

There was a muffled but distinct clunk from the other side of the door. Paul froze.

He was below the barn's eight-inch floor beams. The barn was a great old space that could have stabled eight draft horses, their fodder, and appurtenances, and the equipment to put them to work. The ground floor was a row of four stalls aside an open space. The floor plan was made the larger for another four matching stalls having been removed long ago. A loft above with ropes hanging down. Broken hay on the floor. Over the large doors a smaller pitching door. The roof of slate and moss. It smelled like a barn.

Paul stood on centuries-old flagstones below. He listened. It is impossible for a barn to be silent. He heard a bewildering cacophony of motions ranging from the tiny to the infinitesimal. The insects living in the burly walls massed together would outweigh the smaller farm dog. In the aggregate, their eating and scraping and dying hummed. Damp air moved languidly. It pulled gently at harnesses, chimes, ropes on pulleys, and a hundred other loose fittings. It pushed on the few windows with glass. The tiny motions murmured.

Filmy moisture, seeps, aerosols, and comparatively massive drizzle drops accumulated under eves and slates. The weight compressed aged fibers. A myriad unidentifiable tipping points stored stresses for knotted punches of punctuated equilibrium. Thunderous clicks rolled over the terrified children of ants. They boomed into a great cloud of all but imperceptible ambient sound. What a barn! And deep under all that was barely appreciable, something heavy had intentionally moved.

He listened. Nothing. Eventually, Paul stepped back. He turned. Switched off the bare bulb.

He mounted the mortared fieldstone steps. They twisted a quarter turn upward in a slate-walled passage. Paul emerged to the main floor of the barn. Charles was standing there. Looking at him alertly. Paul was startled. Charles looked to Paul at once pensive and slightly amused. For no good reason, he felt uncomfortable to be seen coming up the cellar steps.

"Hi Lad. Up and at 'em. Good morning for it, eh?

Charles gestured broadly to the valley. The green pickup was now in front of the barn.

"I heard you call. Well, I was thinking we might head up for a bit o' fell-walking. What say you?

Paul had been expecting to be down in the village working at the factory, delivering the product, or in some other way trying to be useful. Aalunae had woke him hours early whispering that he would help Charles instead that day. Shortly after dawn, he rose. The house was quiet. The kitchen's stone, tile, metal, and glass, echoy. There was damped fire and breakfast. He heated it up and tucked in. No Charles.

The Bradford hadn't been in its usual place under the tree. Paul had thought perhaps the barn or the pen behind? He didn't have a plan for the day, so he thought he better go see what he could do to help. If he'd been asked what the day had in store Paul probably would have thought maybe accrual accounting or post hole digging. Either or both. It would be up to Charles. He went looking. Eventually, he found his way to the corner of the barn where the steep unrailed stairs down were a fall waiting to happen. How could he not have a look?

"Sure thing, Grampa. I'm game.

Charles had apparently prepared. Two rucksacks were already in the back of the Bradford, along with a stout copper-tipped walking stick. Paul was wearing an old field sweater. Charles was dressed like a hybrid of Cumbrian farmer and American Southwest cowboy. Long coat, mid-calf boots and wide brim. A taupe canvas squall anorak was hanging on the passenger-side door. It was already damp out. It could get cold on the fells. Paul put it on. They got in and headed up the valley.

They drove, slowly gaining altitude. About two miles to the proximate end of the gravel road. Above them was Steel Rigg. About two hundred meters higher up. They got out and started up a downpour channel scree. The land soon angled up into a scar. Steel Rigg gave a view of the length of the valley. They stopped at the top. Charles drank it in as much as Paul did. It never got old. This wasn't Paul's first ramble with Charles. They were quieter than they had been before.

Longsleddale is relatively long. A narrow valley between five- and six-hundred-foot crags, riggs, and fells. The floor is lush. Its fields are almost flat along the meandering river as it flows towards the drumlins to the south of the dale. The highlands are cut with parliamentary enclosure walls and footpaths. Long rock outcrops and moraines reach along and in. Sheep wander the paddocked upland. A few trees and tributary gills add to the feeling of wildness, strong even in the meticulously sculpted bottom. It is one of England's most charming scenes. Few wouldn't stop to gaze down and get lost in the miniature rural diorama.

Soon enough they moved on. They worked their way along the western heights back towards the other end of the dale. They were high above and north of Fellfall, at the back corner of Charles's land. Charles occasionally pointed out a feature. Mostly they rambled quiet. Charles was steering them through the rough. They had to use their hands more than most fell-walkers do. As Paul came up against the exposed rock, Charles quietly explained the geology in detail like an expert. The rocks were becoming old. Their path, narrow.

In 1932 Charles had found something in what he referred to simply as The Site. The location was hemmed in on three sides. Though passable, not a common path. He had passed through before the day of discovery because he did things the hard way. The new rockfall that slowed him down that day had left a low but more sheer wall. The pinch had become even less easily traversed.

As a climbing challenge, the face was not impressive. Neither high enough for a technical climb nor mild enough to attract casual scramblers. There was a slight inversion near the base that dissuaded footholds. The scree of several small falls, over probably centuries, made for a narrow ankle-twisting debris field. Below the site were boulder fields and knotts. The Site was best circumvented by fells paths on the higher rolling swells leading to the summit.

They arrived. It seemed nowhere special to Paul, yet. Charles suggested elevenses. Paul unpacked food and a small tarp. Charles unlaced his boot and adjusted his prosthetic. As he did, he told a story.

It started with Roman forts, Pictish walls, and Scottish raids. He described Yewbarrow Hall's six-foot thick walls, tithe barns, and the conflicts over the enclosures. He told of hand-hewn slate quarries, lime slaking burns, tin mines, turnpiking, and high railway tunnel controversies. And soon enough he turned again to geology.

Charles was an amateur geologist, as it turned out. It seemed his knowledge on the subject was deeper than Paul would have guessed. He proceeded to direct Paul's attention to the exposed stone. Obliquely, he was explaining why. In a roundabout way Charles gradually gave Paul to understand that they were in rather a special spot indeed.

The hole was still there. It had variously had mud, rocks, moss, and other materials filling it up. Birds and rodents had nested and moved on. Sometimes Charles hadn't bothered to refill it. After all, between common nests and almost equally common centuries-old artisanal mines, there were sufficient reasons for small holes. Without the strange Artifact's artificiality, all the mind needed was the merest excuse to accept the oddly symmetrical form, and move on.

Charles and Paul got up close. They dug out the passage. It had been deeper. Charles had broken the rock face so that the shaft was about eight inches shallower. Once it was clear, they could touch the unnaturally smooth back. The surface was engineered. Not a trace of roughness. They explored the hole with a torch. Charles assembled a telescoping magnifying inspection mirror, like a dentist's mirror scaled up. It revealed little. No grain. No differentiation.

Around the opening, the rock looked glassier and darker the closer to the lip you looked. Charles's chisel and hammer marks had flaked off thin inch-wide sheets of rock perpendicular to the shaft. The marks became jagged and pitted a few inches out from the hole. Discolorations began. Veins and grains. Dishomogeneities. Crystal flecks. Microfossils. Normal chaotic limestone rock.

"At first, I disguised the digging. Over the years I began to realize most people don't have their eyes open. And if they did what then? Wouldn't they just think of miners or quarriers? I stopped covering the hole. Later, I started breaking the wall in other places. I tried digging down from above and the far side. It was hard going. Nothing else has turned up. Yet. I keep looking.

Charles encouraged Paul to work the hammer and collect samples. They toiled for an hour in turns. The result was a cubic inch of sharp-edged glassy rock with a smoothly curved section. Out of context, merely a bit of building material or a fragment of a casting mold. Paul pocked it.

They packed up. They walked up, not down. West, not northeast. Charlies took them up to High Street, the highest ridge in the area. Lined by high stone walls and frequented by fellwalkers. From there they took a well-beaten path southeast back to the top of Longsleddale. Just a couple of local ramblers enjoying the day.

Eventually, they tumbled into the Bradford. Tired, though not wiped out. It was good to drive quietly for a few minutes. They would beat Aalunae home by still some hours. In Fellfall yard, Charles took the truck out of gear, turned the key. They sat there.

"Granpa, can I see it?

Charles smiled slowly.

"What did you think was next, lad?

And so, Paul found himself again in front of the strong ironwood door at the base of the steps descending from the barn floor beside a bare bulb. Listening again. Did Charles pause? He didn't hear the key. The door opened without a sound. It swung with a motion that told of mass, balance, well-machined hinges, lubricant. The room was akin to a safe. Charles twisted a nob. Light. They entered.

Inside was clinical. Completely unlike the barn. Polished cement floor. Bright steel-trellis work racks. Aluminum incandescent work lights. Iron-framed lab bench with stainless steel surface and drawers. Plastic and metal boxes, labeled. Florescent under-rack lights. The oldest article of equipment was a dark slate rinsing sink. There were bright brass drains in the floor. A soundless fan moved air perceptibly. Three floor-to-ceiling metal cabinets took up the far wall. Bright Masterlocks hung on the doors with blue plastic bands. At the center on a drain-lipped steel rolling table, a large fireproof safe.

Charles pulled a four-foot latched metal toolbox from the floor under a table.

"What's in the safe?

Charles grunted and hefted the box onto a lab stool. Flicked the latches.

"Nothing. But it made you look, didin it? Come here, lad. This you don't see every day.

Charles swung an articulated work light over. He opened the lid. The Artifact was not flashy, other than its surreal blackness. It sat on a folded towel daring Paul to find it extraordinary.

"Looks pretty tame, eh?

Paul just looked. He was still a long time. Charles waited.

"Earlier. This morning. When you got to the barn I was down here. At the door.

Charles didn't move. He spoke quietly.

"I saw you.

Paul spoke like he was unsure if he wanted to ask. He didn't know what was important. What might be silly. What profound. He was believing, and yet not one hundred percent there yet.

"I heard something. A heavy clunk.

Charles cocked an eyebrow. Paul didn't see it.

"Interesting. Just that?

Paul agreed.

"Just that.

Paul walked towards Alderley Edge. The mist in his head was clearing. He hadn't forgotten his briefcase or jacket. Wallet, keys, business card holder, check, check, check. After about a mile he thumbed a ride to the station. The next train went through at 8:40 p.m. He bought a roll of Smarties and the paper. The news was thin. He was restless. The train was uneventful. He stumbled into his flat in Stockport a bit before ten. It had not been a great day.

In the morning Craig Burns rang Paul before his coffee cooled and Karabiner's daily craziness got off the rails.

"So, how'd it go with the boffins?

Craig was characteristically peppy. The phone was wrapped around Paul's shoulders. He was attempting bacon while pondering Karabiner’s sales prospects. The Company's Manchester office, to that point, was somewhere between the front room of the flat and the small kitchen. In fact, it was right at the doorway because that was where the heavy beige phone was bolted to the wall.

"Not great. My understanding is that the dish is slathered with Tanine steel. I was given to understand that Karabiner was welcome to bid on procurements. We could work with the Projects Office. I'm cautiously certain that would be a long-drawn-out time of pain and suffering for, potentially, a pittance. I love science, but I don’t love government funding. We need to look elsewhere.

Craig expressed disappointment in a breezy way.

"That sucks. But hey look, the books are sorted, the truck is out. Nobody's in arrears. I've got a line on a guy who can help us find a hole in the wall down there near you. And a cold-water flat for me. I'm spinning all the plates while whistling. You just gotta sell.

Paul grinned.

"Who's the guy? Not a stooge?

Craig turned serious.

"No, man. A friend of a good friend. Name of Corter. A mate of mine escaped to university. This fellow was his roommate. No worries, there.

Craig was not prone to worries. These days they were both more careful than their natures inclined.

"Paul, there was something funny yesterday, though. Not something to worry about. Probably nothing.

Paul stopped chasing the bacon around the pan.

"Ok, what are you talking about, then?

Craig was almost apologetic. It wasn't much of a story.

"I interviewed two people yesterday for the office. The first two, actually. A bloke and a dame.

Paul relaxed enough to carve off enough attention to pull eggs out of the tiny fridge. He sniffed them. They seemed Ok.

"Any good? You said a girl applied for the advert? Was she a steelyarder?

Craig wondered what Paul was doing. He sounded distracted.

"Are you cooking? Really? That's rather bold. Shall I call the fire department now?

Paul wasn't listening. He had dropped an egg and was busy rubbing it into the floor with a rag.

"The guy was fine. Dull. Experienced, I guess. Seemed like a straight shooter. Didn't do much for me, but it was good practice. I sent him off. The woman was different.

Paul had things more or less under control by that point. He was trying to keep his feet out of the slippery patch.

"Different, how so? You're smitten?

Craig didn't sound smitten.

"Not so much. It was odd. She came in the office very serious. Said she was looking for work. I assumed she was calling about the ad. But she didn't know what I was talking about. It seemed like she just waltzed in, but serious like she had picked us out of a lineup.

Paul was paying attention. He didn't like the idea of strangers sniffing around. So far, the long arm of Tanine seemed content to busy itself elsewhere. And yet, leaving well enough alone wasn't like his father.

"I asked her about her business experience. Did she know the building trades or steel or accounting? She knew a few things, maybe. But there wasn't much there. She was about my age, so not an old-timer. She kept looking around when she thought I wasn't looking. I went into the back to get a copy of the ad. When I was out, she got up and looked through the stuff on the desk. Flipped the Rolodex.

Paul stopped cooking. The bacon didn't.

"You saw her poking around our stuff?

Craig's voice was serious.

"Yes, through the crack.

There was a crack in the frame of a window communicating between the narrow front office and a back room. The window was papered over. The office had previously been set up for physical therapy, catering to the large number of damaged industrial workers in Motherwell. It was not in good shape. You could see through cracks in many places. At least the roof didn't leak.

"I made a bunch of noise. When I came back in she acted as if she had just been sitting there. No expression. We talked about her background. That's when she said something odd.

Paul said nothing so Craig would continue. Smoke was beginning to gather over the stove. Paul wasn’t looking.

"She wasn't from here. Her voice sounded like maybe, well, I don't know. Far away, a bit. But also a bit of Irish, I guess. She sounded like she was trying to sound local. I asked her where she was from. She said she had been at school in Dublin. Before that, she said, her family had moved around a lot.

Paul didn't fully see the odd thing.

"The odd thing was, she said she made a point of saying she was becoming Scottish quickly. That she'd been here for three years. Which wouldn't have been my guess. But she said she already had whisky and nippy broon in her blood.

Paul thought that was quite an image. It reminded him of the eggs. Breakfast wasn't shaping up well.

"Have you ever heard that phrase?  "Bleed whisky and nippy broon"? Rather not common, isn't it? Me, I've never.

Paul had never either.

"Ok, so it's a weird thing to say. It does sound like something a person trying to be more Scottish than they are would say. What of it?

Craig sounded worried.

"You remember what I told you about how your family essentially bought me off after the accident? A guy came to the house and got me to sign papers and attest that you were a hero. Which you are! And that the Works was a blameless workers' paradise that fed the men on milk and honey. Which as we know is a complete understatement.

Paul smiled tightly.

"The chap looked like a tough bloke done up like a toff. He was an arm twister, for sure. Since I didn't want to have a beef with the Works, I was good with it.

Paul smirked.

"That, sure. And you were good with the fatted calf they roasted for you. A cushy job with only half the usual threats to life and limb. Sign me up too.

Craig wasn't smiling at his end.

"Your father's man said that same thing. That's what got me. Said it almost the same way. He said the Tanines bleed whisky and nippy broon.  Who says that?

Paul got it.

"That is odd. I've never heard it before. Did you say anything to her?

Craig was glad Paul didn't think he was being silly.

"No. Nothing. Anyway, what could I have said? Your efforts to be super Scottish are weird and suspicious? Nah, I tried to probe a bit. But mostly I just thanked her for her time. Said we'd call if there was an opportunity for her.

Paul considered. It was thin. But plausible.

"Maybe you could ask around a bit. See if anyone knows her. What was her name?

Craig thought for a second. Performing a feat of quotidian time travel he couldn't always pull off. In this case, however, the woman had made an impression on him.

"Roseafey. It was Roseafey Dalynn.

"
About twenty space-time miles south of Paul another pair were also hard at work. They were preparing one of them to stand out from a crowd. Anakoni Athair, called Koni, was endeavoring to keep electric blue hair die off her face and out of her eyes as her fraternal twin, See See, attempted to get same worked in. Right into her brain, Koni was sure. It was not a precision operation. The science was prehistoric.

Koni was preparing for an opening at a local gallery. The Observatorium Gallery was named in reference to the area's biggest tourist attraction. The owner, Cormu Fauquier, was an eccentric fellow that assumed the more one stood out, the more one stood a chance of commercial success in a crowded art market. He also worked on the theory that the next generation of artists was where the next world-overturning art wave would rise from.

What was such a colorful and forward-thinking showman doing in quaint little Holmes Chapel? Better London, surely! The answer was simple and, purportedly, temporary. Thirty-three-year-old Cormu was being a filial son. His adoptive mother, Imera Fauquier, was said to be in her nineties. Where in her nineties, exactly, was a mystery to all. What wasn't mysterious was her need for frequent care.

Cormu had come to the village a couple of years prior to provide support for what he reasonably thought would be a very short time. A month turned into many months. Imera rallied. Cormu had found that he quickly become ensconced in a milieu he found charming. One in which he didn't have to work hard to stand out. He figured London or New York would be there for him in a few years whenever he was ready.

That summer Cormu hadn't yet scored a big opening for his little gallery. He had decided to try something new. A young artists three-day exhibition featuring the most creative of the children of the plentiful, quirky families of all the elite astrophysicists, cosmologists, quantum gravity theorists, and the like lurking about the area. Rich fields to plow in a countryside that bred weird science kids. All of which seemed to be, if not artistic geniuses, at least expressive of a creatively that was out of this world. And for Cormu, it was right on brand.

Koni fit right in. She was a talent. Her art projects had already made a few next-gen-, movers under twenty-, new vision-type exhibitions in Manchester and Liverpool. Every one of them was a time of great excitement, no matter how small or how many other up-and-coming artists her work was crowded in by. She was in her element, competing mainly with her own past works. If she surprised only herself, she was ecstatic. What fun!

Like Cormu's everything, her wall-mounted pieces were right on brand. They were kinetic. About time and space. Art that didn't move was hardly art to Koni. And art that moved predictably was boring. Unpredictably evolving creations spoke to the past, and in some ways uncovered the future. Where See See saw the world as a big analog clockwork computer to be disassembled, Koni lived in a beautifully emergent work of art, as huge as a planet because it was a planet.

The piece she would show that evening would capillarily percolate chemicals from top to bottom with various reactions, causing dramatic color and form changes that, if it all worked, would eventually uncover a chiaroscuro of a young portraitist with flying hair burning neon blue. All hermetically sealed, of course. Killing the visitors would piss off Cormu. He had no idea what he was getting himself into.

Cormu encouraged exhibitionism in his young exhibitionists. Hence the blue. Koni had never dyed her hair any color before. It was in its natural state not quite brown, not quite red. Pretty interesting on its own merits, but not flashy. The morning's action would fix that. See See thought it a bit nuts. She was persuaded to help anyway. To distract herself from worrying about how she was going to get the blue off herself, her clothes, the floor, and, goodness sakes, everywhere, she told Koni about the story from the night before.

"So, I met an interesting boy at the party last night. Maybe "boy"'s not the right word. A bit older than me. But whatever.

Koni bubbled something about why did you go to a stupid party, you hate those things.

"Wasn't really the party. I was busy pilfering something from the Control Room. Tell you later. Anyway, this guy came in. Apparently, he had been trying to sell something. I don't know what. Doesn't matter.

Koni to her credit, in See See's eyes, didn't start teasing her about boys. That obviously wasn't the point. Koni generally missed the point. But at least she wasn't annoying about it. Usually.

"So, Mom came and pulled me away to help her solder some contraption. No, I don't know what it was. Anyway, when we got to her workshop she asked me questions. Told me to keep clear of him.  Very serious and mysterious. She wouldn't tell me what. Said I should ask Dad.

Koni wasn't impressed with the idea of Cori being mysterious. That was one of the givens in the equations of the house physics.

"Anyway, so I asked Dad. He was up in the treehouse rewiring the cosmos. I plied him with gross party cake. He told me a story. He said he was going to fib outrageously or something. Did a jolly good job of it.

The streaks of blue swirling down the drain were turning pretty dark.

"Are you done yet? It's been ages. It has to be even and dark. Electric!

See See saw a contradiction in Koni's demands. So she ignored them.

"Turns out this boy comes from a terrifying family. Apparently, Dad dated his mother in university. Briefly. When he was helping Lovell create the Observatory out of a dirt field, under a punishing sun, with his bare hands, starving and thirsty, etc., etc. All that. She was doing more or less the same at the botany station across the road.

Koni was back to bubbling. See See was absentmindedly kneading.

"They broke it off. Apparently, this Lasha was right annoyed. Dad was being chased by another girl. He seemed a little smug about it. Which is weird, but whatever.

See See wrinkled her nose. She continued.

"So, Lasha didn't like that. Dad says she poisoned the other girl. Imagine. If Mom hadn't told me to ask him about it I would have laughed. I guess Mom would have used bespoke brass thumbscrews or something, but poison's pretty conkers too.

The sink was backing up. She dunked Koni's head in the blue water playfully, resulting in bubbly squeaks. Koni sprang herself up, spraying blue water on the ceiling.

"Hey! Quitit!

See See squished her blue hands through the front of Koni's hair.

"I think you're done. Let it sit for fifteen minutes.

Koni stopped glaring.

"Twenty minutes. I want bright blue.

She sat down on the toilet and told See See to continue.

"So, the girl recovered. Barely. She left school. Lasha married this industrialist up north. A steel guy from Glasgow named Mac. All Scottish people are named Mac.

Koni agreed about Scottish people.

"Mac was trying to get Husband to buy all the steel for the telescope from him. Husband didn't want to do it. Dad says Lasha's husband sabotaged the project. Somehow made the dish's panels fall off. Killed someone with a one-ton steel slab. Cut him clean in half!

Koni was all ears. Who wouldn't love a story about people being sliced in half by falling steel? It sounded artistic! Anyway, where was she going to go with her wet head full of blue dye?

"Lovell told Husband to buy the steel from Mac. Apparently, the police found nothing. It was hushed up. Powerful people wanted the project to work out, so they just kept going. Probably good the telescope became geopolitically important. Presumably, no one would try to sabotage it now.

See See was watching Koni for signs she was believing her. Koni always believed her. The reverse wasn't true. That didn't matter right then.

"And Dad said there were other stories. Lasha apparently poisoned people like a lot. Dying left and right. Meanwhile, Mac basically ran the steel industry around Glasgow like his private empire. The government in his pocket. Still does, I guess. And he said they say Lasha's mom had a reputation as someone you don't want to cross, too. All very colorful stuff.

Koni was smiling now. Color!

"So basically, you're to be frightened off and never see this monster boy again, is that it? How very droll. Dad avoided The Talk by making it a police matter. Bully for him! He's very smart.

Koni's world was more ironic than See See's. It was also much more perceptive and intuitive. In fact, Koni took after their dad so much See See wondered if she was clairvoyant. Koni's tangled relationship with the future was presumably inherited from her father's obsession with the ramifications of massive objects on the cosmological space-time continuum. It was just there in the background.

For that reason, See See was a bit taken aback when Koni confidently declared.

"I see it now, Sis. You are going to marry him. It's obvious, you're going to live happily ever after with your own little terrifying family. It will probably piss Mom and Dad off. We'll still come to visit you on Boxing Day. Please don't poison us!

She giggled at the thought and splattered more electric blue on a wall that was already looking like abstract art. Koni was done with stories. She was on to the next thing on the agenda: getting the dye off everything and getting on with a fun day of arty mayhem with Cormu.

See See became subdued. She had things to ponder.

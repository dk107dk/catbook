>1967 - A hero of Motherwell

"Lasha, what is it?  You sound awful. Is everyone Ok? Talk to me.

The few times they had tried, Aalunae couldn't stand talking by telephone with Aalasha. Her mood-riven daughter was a full-spectrum communicator. The twisted-pair of what would one day become known as the Plain Old Telephone Service filtered Aalashaâ€™s Rachmaninoff's |Liebeslied| down an unraveling guitar string slip-knotted to a cheap Spanish guitar with predictable effects.

"It's Paul. Mac sent him to the mill alone. To learn real-life or grow into a man or some nonsense. He got badly hurt. I'm so ungodly angry.

Aalasha was spitting into the phone. Alaunae heard a noise like a china cup crashing to the floor. She waved away one of her employees. Slid around the corner through a doorway. Shut the door on the cord and leaned against the wall. This obviously wasn't how she liked her few reunions with her distant child.

"Sweetie, go slow. Take a moment. Tell me all about it.

Aalasha felt her face moving involuntarily. She took a deep breath. She didn't tell her mom she was done with Mac. With his manipulative plans, plots, games, and gamesmanship. She didn't tell her mom that she was afraid. Of losing her children. Of her brooding anger. Of her falling inhibitions. Of her upper-class invulnerability-muffled despondency. She didn't say what she saw on the ceiling in the middle of the night. She didn't get into what her gardens grew. She didn't need to.

Aalunae let her daughter talk, and as she did Aalunae calmed her breathing. Her yellowed but still sharp canine left a deep red dimple on the side of her forefinger. As the skin slowly rebounded, her eyes softened.

"Mum, you and Da need to take him. Would you? Just till school in the autumn. Would you take him? He could learn to be happy in the countryside. Would you please?

It was never in question. It was more than time for Paul to learn the fells. He needed to know his grandparents. Aalunae needed to know that Charles had had a chance to really get to know Paul. Nobody was getting any younger.

The conversation continued a little longer. The heat dissipated. The important part was done.

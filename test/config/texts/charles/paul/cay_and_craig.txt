>1967 - Paul saves a life in Dalzell Works, Motherwell

Since the late nineteenth century, the Tanine metals holdings were centered on Motherwell. Steelopolis, as it became known. The steel capital of the world. Even more, its beating heart was on the grounds that would become Ravenscraig Steel Works. The Tanines were one of a small number of steel-bashing baronies. They based their empires on extraction and built thickly in the area.

First came the Dalzell Malleable Iron Works. Then in 1890, the Lanarkshire Works sprang up close to the east, gobbling several smaller factories. As steel displaced iron, the steelmakers doubled down on the same brownfields. Tanine created Dalzell Steel Works. Later, in 1950 as the industry was scaling up to chase foreign competitors, Tanine partnered to build the enormous Ravenscraig Steel Works. Ravenscraig soon became by far the largest of these three collocated works. Combined they were the ferric ground zero.

Industry clumps up in small geographic areas that go white-hot with the competition. It is a simple matter of human resources. The people that know how to do a thing well teach others. This creates a foundational self-reinforcing capability that many employers want to tap. Heavy industry has important secondary considerations. What natural resources are available? Is there logistical support? How deep is the pool of the makers of industrial inputs? Are the customers nearby? It all feeds on itself. In certain places, at certain times, an industry grows explosively. Motherwell was one of those places.

The site for the works was wrapped and sectioned with rail spurs and utility pipes. Private roadways outlined the miles-square block. There were slag heaps and fuel dumps. There were gas tanks and water towers. Within each factory, more rights of way were run for internal logistics. Along those, tower cranes. Outside the grounds grew a warren of supplies warehouses, fabricators, assemblers, emergency responders, hired labor agencies, churches, union halls, bars, nightclubs, hourly rooms, and other participants in hard work. All both facilitating and parasitical. They hugged the ring road and fed on the scraps.

Politics was an atmospheric presence. Local waivers were issued with quids pro quo. The landscape was altered to suit the industrialists. Public utilities were persuaded to invest in the enabling infrastructure needed. Management paid well to field the best and most friendly politicians. It also paid to break the unions. In the process, their goons broke the fingers of union reps and the hearts of union organizers.

The works were nationalized in 1949. Privatized in 1952. Re-nationalized in 1967. And, of course, privatized again in the 1980s. Clear-cutting the politics was as important as flattening the landscape had been.

The almost obscenely engorged industrial behemoth, Ravenscraig, lived fast and died young. After it was conjured from dirt, grew explosively, aged prematurely, died, and was scrubbed to bedrock again, the small, contrived village of Ravenscraig rose. Tanine Holdings suddenly had no interest in owning a village. Their interest was mass production, not the land and people it took to effect it. Tanine withdrew, predictably, profitability intact.

Through all that change and much more, the Tanines continuously spun out new ventures and hired experienced managers to run them. Over time, they settled into a pattern. The Family built fast, then pulled back. They sought to divest management control, increase financial control, and prevent political control.

"
In 1950, Craig Chester Burns, grandson of Cayton Burns, was born. He was named for two things. One that didn't yet exist, the Ravenscraig mill. The other, an artifact sequestered by a Chesterian in Kendal that existed but couldn't be spoken of. Craig was the son of Kendal Burns. Yes, both he and his father's names were a direct result of Craig's grandfather's knowing Charles Chesterian. Craig was born at the edge of the torn and polluted demesne that would host the Ravenscraig Steel Works. Generally, he thrived.

The day Craig almost stopped thriving started easy. His mom told him to get a haircut. She said if it grew any longer he would get it caught in the hammer. He didn't work with a drop-forge. That wasn't her point. She told him he needed to get used to making his own lunch. At the same time, she handed him his lunch. He walked outside before dawn in a pair of new-to-him shoes that were pretty comfy. It would take a bit for his feet to remold the insoles. They looked good. There was going to be Sun. The street was drying. It would be warm. He walked quickly, expecting a good day.

At Dalzell House, Paul was late and scrambling. His day was less certain to be a good one. He ran through the large kitchen. Grabbed a lunch pail. Tumbled into the car. The under butler had drawn the short straw. He wasn't happy about it. He had other things to do. Paul was heading to the corner of Albert and Park. It was less than two miles. If he weren't late, he might have walked; though, Rees wouldn't have approved of him walking to Dalzell Works in the dark. It was a rough neighborhood.

Dropped off at the gate, Paul would duck through and run alongside the eight-hundred-fifty-foot-long diagonal iron castings shed. At the end were the main steel mill buildings. His work that day was clearing debris. Mac interspersed hard labor with white-collar work to, as he said, keep Paul honest. This was not white-collar. He would be dirty and very likely bruised. Getting fired for lateness would be a disaster. If that were going to happen it would happen at the end of the day. After the bruises.

The Dalzell Works yard was over a mile in circumference. It was not nearly as big as the newer Ravenscraig Steel Works under construction just behind it. Ravenscraig was a full square mile. Nevertheless, to Paul, Dalzell Works was absolutely mammoth. The more so for being unfamiliar territory.

The older mill's front doors on Park Street were from a different age. They were set in a relatively ordinate brick facade, compared to the sheet metal sheds. Tall dark mahogany with inlaid brass. The doors stood between a pair of double stone pillars. The offices were a very small part of a very large and rough heavy industry titan. Paul had been inside the front office once years before. It impressed him. Dalzell was a profitable venture. The clean part was not where he was headed on that day. Dressed as he was, he wouldn't have been let in.

One of the ways Dalzell maintained its profitability was by keeping labor costs low. Management compressed wages. Demanded long hours. Traded off safety for efficiency. Patched old equipment that should have been retired. Took risks. The site averaged an accident of note every day. Management said fatalities were rare. But to evaluate the accuracy of that statement you first had to ask: rare by what measure?

Compared to other steel mills, it was supposedly true. After all, most of Dalzell's workers did not die on the job. Compared to the post office? False, fatalities were common. Compared to, say, a hairdresser's? Fatalities were essentially a constant presence. Workers were casually afraid. There were many ways and means of dying at Dalzell Works. Creativity would get you nowhere in terms of promotion and respect. A creative death would give you deathless fame. It happened.

Paul was out of breath when he hit the starting line. The heat was already on. He grabbed an apron and punched in. The sweeps and clinks corner was a small room off a larger stores bay. He tucked his lunch and jacket in the heavy dust behind a horse-whipped filing cabinet. Ran out to the red muster line painted on the cement just as assignments started.

A taller boy hissed at him and pulled his apron forward.

"Dobber bairn. To the line quick. Yer day gonna start poorly.

Paul clocked in at barely fifteen. He was still waiting for his expected growth spurt. Playing the card, he stood just slightly behind the line so as to look like he might have been there all along. The assignments went fast. The super didn't know their names, just pointed and barked. Paul was assigned by area. That meant there was a foreman that would hand down work as it appeared. The tall boy pushed him out and pointed.

"Follow that yun. Good luck to ya.

Paul ran after the older boy indicated. It was getting hotter.

They quick-walked a quarter mile to the other end of the central shed. Paul several steps behind and struggling. On the right heading east, bays with overhead belts, shoots, and hand truck chain derricks. Tracks ran the centerline. Pig iron and coal cars. Metal slabs and billets. Carbon and chromium ores. Palletized hard goods, bins, rolls. Over the center cranes transporting hot crucibles and plate slabs. On the left, three-story chimneys over open-hearth furnaces, giving way to forging, rolling, and cutting bays.

Paul followed three boys ahead of him on a weaving course that avoided large, heavy, hot things. Fans, carts, swinging chains, and electric runs were also to be avoided. The noise was palpable. He felt bewildered. It was his third day on site. The furthest he had been from the entrance. It was a fright. He hurried on, eyes open.

Eventually, they turned left into a marginally more open space. This was their bay. It was a hot rolling operation. Heated slabs traveled by conveyor through several two-story three-foot compression rollers stations. Roughing and finishing mills. The metal was thinned down to a long five-foot-wide strip. The strips were then coiled-in into one-ton five-foot in diameter rolls. The glowing hot rolls emerging from the coil box were hoisted onto cooling racks. Eventually, they would be banded and conveyored out of the building onto waiting flatcars.

The boys moved materials. They fed belts and linked chains. Swept splattered metal. Checked pipes and dewatered collection pans. Pulled and emptied trolleys. And did a hundred other short, often heavy, jobs. Everything was hot and in motion. Orders came fast, loud, and short from the catwalks.

The four boys were in constant danger. They had to have eyes in the back of their heads. Practically, that meant being aware of how others reacted to what was outside their field of view. And then stepping smartly in a direction they guessed was safe. By noon Paul had barely missed catching a sampling rod in the head, having his foot run over by a steel roll, and receiving sprays of slag and scalding water.

He had a ten-minute lunch. Then Paul did a consequential thing. It was a good thing, in that it probably saved a life.

Craig Burns was leaning over the roller arms of one of the giant Siemens press mills. It was stilled a few minutes for maintenance. He was clearing the main roller. The roller was three-foot in diameter, eight-foot-wide. Its job was heavy compression. This roller wasn't spinning true. Craig was up against the machine to find out why and fix it. Craig was a smart guy with skills. In and of itself, it wasn't the kind of job that demanded his utmost attention.

Instead, Craig was thinking of the weekend coming up. There was a girl who he met by the introduction of the organ master of St. Mary's. Anna Fey. She was an Irish Scott with a wicked sense of humor. It seemed she was interested in spending time with him. Perhaps bicycling along the river? He had a little money to spend. It might make a good start.

Paul was at the front of the press. He was running a rake across the press reels and platform to knock out debris. He could see Craig's belt dangling around the corner from him. So far he had burned his hands and wrists only several times. With his head thrust in the dark gap, Paul could just see Craig’s reedy legs. He knew who he was, one of the operators, but didn’t really know his job, his full name, or really anything about him. Such was scrambling at Dalzell Works.

When the horn sounded far up the line, Paul would have about ten seconds to get his rake out and get clear of the crushing gears. Not even twenty to get back from the deluge, the steam burst from descaling, and the fast reversing press runs. There was always the chance for a spray of hot steel. Craig would need to be clear as well. More so. He was directly in the line the three-thousand-degree plate would run.

Then it happened. In rapid-fire. Paul lost his rake. It bounced off a housing suddenly in motion. The horn sounded. But weakly like the compressor had broken. The gears started up. One of his fingers was pinched, only just avoiding maiming. Rollers were suddenly spinning. Craig either didn't hear or didn't recognize the horn's meaning. His belt caught and yanked up. He was pulled in. He came off his feet. He was at least lucky enough that he wasn’t pulled right into the rollers.

One hundred yards away four sun-color slabs were sliding out of the furnace onto the conveyor. The air above them quaking. At first slowly. Then abruptly when each hit the forty-foot runway leading to the descaling machine it accelerated to about thirty miles per hour. Through the suppressor chains. Hit by high-pressure water jets. Out and twenty more feet to the first two-story-tall press where Paul and Craig were working. It was a four-inch-high incandescent freight train. Heading at Craig's kicking legs.

Paul didn't know what was wrong. Why the sudden start-up? His heart was thudding with adrenaline. He was afraid of the plates and machines. His rake was where it shouldn't be. He didn't know what that would do.

Paul was not thinking. He was moving. He sprinted around the machine. Jumped to the narrow platform along the conveyor. The whole foundation was rumbling and shaking. Hot wind. Paul leaped over the rollers. Slammed his one hundred-and eighteen-pound body into Craig's one-hundred-and-forty-pound frame.

It was just enough. The belt gave way. Perhaps Craig had managed to at least get it unbuckled. The rake snapped and javelined out of the mill with a report. They crashed over the edge into an access trench. Paul's left leg was hit by the glowing metal shooting out of the press, now just a three-inch high plate. His pants were instantly cauterized into his calf as he was helicoptered by the force. His head came down on a railing. He was out. His last sense was the smell of hot metal and burnt flesh. His.

"
"You're Ok laddie. You're Ok.

Paul was shivering. His head felt like it was hanging backwards over a cliff in a cold wind. His leg was burning. His hand crashed into something hard.

"Easy there. Do you know where you are? Take some water.

Paul located the voice. It came from a thick man with black on his face. A furnace operator.

"Your name is Paul, righto? You're in the infirmary. You had a close one.

He felt woozy. The man swayed over him.

"My name is Ed. I'm your union rep. You saved a man's life today. Bloody good show.

Paul was not in a position to appreciate the compliment. His head pulsed and swam. Leg screaming. The image of a sheet of pure energy coming at him. A knife made of the sun. Falling. Spinning.

Paul needed rest. He needed the pain to stop. He needed to know Craig was Ok.

And most of all he needed his father to know that he had sent Paul to hell in shirtsleeves with bare hands. Mac needed to know: death stalked Dalzell Works.

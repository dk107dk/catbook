>1968 - Mackintosh surveils Cadzow Castle, Hamilton, Scotland

There are steep bluffs over the Avon Water where it cuts through Chatelherault Country Park. Those are in a small corner of the former lands of the Palace Hamilton. At that point stands the remains of what was once a substantial castle. Cadzow Castle was last a redoubt more than three hundred years prior.

The Castle is less than two miles, as flies the crow, from Dalzell House. It is only eight hundred or so feet by crow to Chatelherault Hunting Lodge. And only about a mile more would have taken you, in Robert Tanine's time, to the grand Palace itself. Those four sites – two castles, a palace, and a grand folly – are by no means the sum of the artifacts of ancient wealth littered about their leg of the Clyde. South Lanarkshire is just lousy with this stuff.

When Mac was a child, his father Robert, was shaken by the impending loss of Hamilton Palace. Hamilton was then one of Britain’s most magnificent palaces. That in an island where magnificent estates were once as common as rock doves. The Palace was to be razed due to its thoughtless former residents selling the subsurface mining rights. As it turned out, the rich coal seam below was removed in such a way that the integrity of the gilded halls was entirely compromised. Robert was stricken. Scotland was losing part of its elitist, imperial soul.

Now, Robert was also chagrined. Though it wouldn't do to show it. He was less than mortified, yet without question at least a little annoyed, that the name Tanine would never be carved into the gate of the palace. Bluntly, even the Tanines couldn't have afforded to keep up that stupendous pile long. However, the estate being several opulent square miles in girth, it held other treasures. Some were more affordable.

Chatelherault Hunting Lodge was one such. It was a folly set as a foil to the palace. It sat at the far end of a mile-long manicured promenade. From a distance, it looked like another entire palace. Up close it was easily seen to be a thin three-story cut of ashlar and glass built over a massive multilayer stone pedestal containing mews, kennels, kitchens, storerooms and the like. Merely an ordinate hunting lodge and stables, swollen up to stately home scale. Where Dalzell House stood a fair chance in a siege, Chatelherault was far better suited to a fairytale wedding. Robert was tempted.

Ultimately, of course, the Tanines stayed at Dalzell. It suited them. The Hunting Lodge would have required too much redevelopment. In the course of Robert’s consideration, Mac had hours of play in the ruins of the estate's adjacent Cadzow Castle. Cadzow's state of repair wasn't good. The local Council had reluctantly determined that the castle wasn't fit to be accessible to the general public. That wasn't a good description of little Mac Tanine. He wandered and clambered without restriction or concern. He brought ropes and spikes, chalk and lunch. He imagined knights and bandits. He was stung by nettles and bees. He had a grand old time.

"Dalzell, thank you for seeing us.

The leader of the Preservation Society was named Burns. He seemed unsure of how to address Mac. Mac sitting for an audience in the upper Drawing Room at Sunday tea in Dalzell House had all the appurtenances of "My lord" or of "Dalzell". The latter was correct, according to the good Lord Lyon. Mac accepted it without regard. He was neither impatient, nor involved, with forms of address. He wished to proceed to the subject at hand.

"Not at all, Mister Burns. It is my pleasure. I have a long association with the castle and would see it, by all means, preserved. Tell me everything.

Burns looked at his elder companions. They knew the Tanines by reputation and impact. There had been discussion. It was judged that forging ahead was worth it. The concern was that Mac, like Robert before him, was unpredictable. Attracting his quick calculating attention might be of a questionable value, wrapped in the considerable risk of a loss of control. Burns swallowed carefully and continued.

"Castle Cadzow is crumbling, as you know. It has been open to the public for many years. As the party responsible, per the county’s direction, our society attempts to control access. So far, our success has been spotty. And to be sure we are only keen to succeed out of concern for the welfare of the citizenry. Our preference is of course to stabilize the walls and reopen the grounds.

Mac looked thoughtful. He of course already knew all this. Klade had made inquiries. The Society sought substantial funds. Their hushed hopes were for the Laird Dalzell to take the castle preservation as his charitable outlet for years, resulting in due course of grants of perhaps millions of pounds. This meant making an accounting-driven argument, and without saying tax avoidance in so many words. They were ill-prepared to deliver on their goal, given their lack of familiarity with the schemes of fabulous wealth.

Having sussed it all out in advance, Mac thought he could spare Burns the embarrassment. He had a few ideas. They spun threads through dimensions Burns and company could hardly have guessed. And Mac moved at a speed of acumen they were long past. As feared, Mac had become focused. They had already lost control.

The only question left was: would the castle be preserved, or perhaps stormed?

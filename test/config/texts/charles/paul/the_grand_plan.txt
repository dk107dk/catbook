Planet Earth - 1993

The original plan had been simple. Basically, get Charles the heck out of Dodge. Let him leave the World. At least that fraction of the World that noticed. They would mourn a lost Golden Age of Exploration hero. It would keep anyone else from noticing Charles stubbornly not aging. Keep their unidentified adversaries in the dark. And in the meantime, figure out what to do next. What to do next was quickly named The Grand Plan. Of course it was.

The Grand Plan didn’t fall into place in a neat manilla binder stamped CHRONOS - Top Secret. The outlines, however, became quite clear over time. Charles would get out of sight in the far north. Gunnarr would provision him on a regular schedule. As soon as possible Falaise Maths, son of Jamphe and Koni Maths, could expand their business to polar logistics and take over support. Paul would fund a non-profit that would undertake polar science on Svalbard. Aron and Amber would attempt to get their project, GNOSIS, to use Svalbard as a cache site. Charles would join the science non-profit unobtrusively as an over-wintering caretaker, once everything was in place. The other family members would focus on creating the wealth and scientific resources needed to unravel the Artifact's mystery, and presumably to make use of it in some way.

Simple, right?

The devil was in the details. The first part was relatively easy. As the survivor of several arctic forays, Charles was relatively comfortable on his own in the vastness of the high arctic. Provisioning, communications, isolation, the need to be invisible, and a host of other problems were all quite surmountable. And he was looking forward to it. No one was skeptical. Everyone was worried.

The Maths commercial operations were harder to set up. Their hard-scrabble mini-conglomerate could enter arctic shipping easily enough. Or at least, it could work its way into readiness to do so in time. Still, it had to have a reason to do it. And it needed a profit in order to be sustainable. The captive non-profit could fill in some initial demand. Gunnarr a bit more. However, there needed to be a believable narrative and sustainability. Without that, eventually, someone would start asking inconvenient questions.

The non-profit wasn't a shoo-in either. Paul couldn't set it up himself. That wouldn't last a day. Their adversaries would almost immediately glom on. Instead, they needed a proxy. One that looked compelling enough. If anyone looked – when they looked – at its contributor list, Paul's name needed to be an inconspicuous entry, assuming the source of funds couldn’t be completely obscured. Finding a blank-slate proxy would be hard. One that would be in the dark and yet steerable, harder. Aron thought he might have an idea about that.

Once the non-profit was created, there would need to be a plan for getting it a physical presence in the arctic. A physical site could be arranged by Gunnarr. He could also solve most regulatory matters, given time and money. The logistics to deliver construction and science materials were doable. They needed a general contractor with expertise in arctic construction. Those existed.

There were local people to charm and disarm. They would need to get cover projects with really convincing objectives started. CHRONOS needed to be welcomed and effective in each of its several guises.

Along with the construction of a science organization, there was the construction of two camps for Charles. One, a highly camouflaged main living quarters. Small and easy to hide. The other, an essentially invisible bolt-hole. Along with the two camps, nearby but not too close, a tiny dug-in bunker to securely house the Artifact. Building those without outside help would be hard for the few members of CHRONOS to manage. Paul would lead.

The bolt-hole and the bunker would merely be delaying tactics. If Charles were found, the assumption was that he would talk and then die. There's only so much a person can take. And no way would an adversary let Charles live when it would be so much easier to stuff him in a hole in the ice. They obviously needed to avoid this outcome through stealth, planning, and precision. Never having tried and failed, they assumed they could pull this off.

All in all, the expectation was that Charles was facing years of living solo on the ice. The number of years was probably not two. There could be brief visits to Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund during the summers. Charles could occasionally manage vacations on trawlers and pleasure craft. It was at least something.

It would be, nevertheless, a crushing |purdah| in a wild and dangerous place. Could he take it? Charles thought he could. For years. He hoped not many more than two. Could it be done elsewhere? Probably, however, regardless, isolation would be required. And any place with people would have required even more preparedness than that the family was completely lacking in at the outset. They decided to risk it, trusting they could evacuate Charles in a crisis.

The main task of Aron and Amber was more speculative. GNOSIS was fully up and running, finally. It had sites in Oceania and North America. Europe was on the bucket list. Perhaps they could get the project to leverage Svalbard's international openness, geologic stability, and remoteness to create the European cache. On the other hand, perhaps they couldn't. It was worth a try. Between Aron's influence with Royal Little, and the fact that other groups had proposed similar things on Svalbard in decades past, it was a real possibility. Of course, Aron thought he had a clever way to do it. And of course, Amber thought he had a screw loose.

If Aron could influence the selection of the European site, perhaps he could go further. Could Aron also interest Royal in creating the non-profit needed for Charles? Ostensibly it would be a cover for GNOSIS? And it could be a useful misdirection there, for sure. Once set up by Aron's team, they would have a conspiracy within a conspiracy. That would be delicious. Aron had more ideas. Those needed to percolate a bit longer.

The other family members had their own roles. First and foremost, money. Everything other than giving up required a boatload of cash. Paul, through Karabiner, had immediate funds. However, far more was needed. All the Schillers, Tanines, and Maths were enlisted to build wealth. To do that, they needed ventures, seed capital from Paul, Aron, and Buco, and an extraordinary appetite for risk. In all this, however, just as with Charles, they needed to be invisible.

All easier said than done.

>1962 - Paul's apprenticeship begins in Motherwell

The Tanine kids attended a well-regarded local day school. Not because it was well-regarded. Because it was nearby. Its closeness allowed Paul, especially, and Aalana to continue their education in more practical ways in the afternoons. It also didn't hurt that the Dalziel School hovered in the general vicinity of affordable. Mac didn't care a fig about the cost. However, it allowed him to insinuate that his children attended an accessible local school out of a commitment to the community. A small point, but one that could be scored often.

In fact, Dalziel School was quite a reputable institution and Paul and Aalana enjoyed it. They could walk to school through the fields. Both were reasonably, if reservedly, popular. Aalana dominated the chess club ruthlessly. She relied on humor and strategically self-sabotaged games to keep from being a complete oppressor. Paul had decided on the rugby team. However, soon his time for games was truncated, pinched by a compulsory vocational Tanine apprenticeship.

Tanine Holdings was sprawling. Opportunities for learning dotted the landscape thickly. From wharves to industrial estates. From Motherwell to Glasgow to Dumbarton. Paul was given to understand that he would make a grand tour. And that his good graces depended on him applying himself up to the Tanine standard. Ultimately the holding company's interests were a tangled skein. Paul wasn't given choices. How were his assignments to be chosen? Paul had no idea.

The greatest challenge for Paul’s Tanineification was not the number of opportunities. It was the quickly changing nature of the local economic environment. Competition waxed and waned. Business cycles swung. Industries rose and fell.

Fifty years prior, Tanine steel formed hundreds of large-scale ships built on the Clyde every year. Tanine joint ventures bent the steel. Tanine controlled foundries rolled it. Tanine subsidiaries mined the raw material and energy. Tanine investments funded the inputs and innards: pumps, turbines, welding torches, coal cutters, furnace gimbals, valve drive motors, steel wire and rivets, and much more. However, things changed.

Starting in the late nineteenth century Dale Tanine, Paul's great grandfather, had kicked off a concerted effort to diversify beyond the Family's base: coal, glass, and ironworks. He saw it as moving up the food chain. His son, Robert Tanine, had accelerated the process. He had an aggressive focus on vertical integration. Facing change, Tanine money found its way into ever more industries. Robert said he would rather buy from himself than butter another family's bread.

The next in line, Mac Tanine, had appreciated the power of operating at scale and depth. That said, his turn at the tiller slewed towards a more balanced position. Heavy industry at the core. Diversification as loss-protection. Vertical integration to more completely attach the value chain. Financial innovation to jack up the scale and weaponize competitors' own competitiveness.

Despite all this savvy, the family had a weakness. It was its continuing attachment to the River Clyde. The Tanine soft underbelly wasn't their own missteps. Rather it was the combined late empire missteps of all Scotland. Had Dale, Robert, or Mac invested more successfully overseas, their position might have been stronger. And Paul's apprenticeship perhaps even more stimulating.

But the Tanines were too much died-in-the-wool Scottish nationals. National pride had become a provincialism to rival even the Tanine's unswerving loyalty to their own interests. And fundamentally both instincts were blinders. Paul didn't see this right away. It’s not clear that Mac ever did. He was too busy belting out the |Alba an Àigh| louder than the Glasgow Phoenix Choir.

"   Land of my high endeavour,
"   Land of the shining river,
"   Land of my heart forever,
"   Scotland the brave.

Paul was injected into part-time roles. Haphazardly, as he saw it. Three months here, three months there. Interspersed with occasional bouts of full-time work. During those he would work out of some grimy dormitory in some dirty company town. Taking rough |scran| with the men and boys. Learning to talk like a factory hand.

More often he was just dropped off in the early afternoon at the front of one of a succession of gray two-story brick boxes. They were stuffed with angry managers, silent draftsmen, and surly shift supervisors. Dour windows over materials yards and factories. Paul had no allies to fend this off. His school could say nothing to his abbreviated schedule or occasional leaves of absence.

When he arrived, sometimes Paul wasn’t even expected. He would be handed off as Someone Important's kid. Harried ink-stained ill-pressed shirts had little time for him. He was introduced by his first name. In some circles the name Tanine had the power to stop conversations. Paul used it as little as possible. Only partners and board members quickly comprehended whose kid he was.

Paul hated it. He was perceptive enough to thank heaven it wasn't worse. Aalana saw the strain. She felt bad for him. But what could she do?

Some nights Paul wound up waiting on the curb in the Scottish cold. Usually hungry. Eventually, the driver picked him up. Paul didn't imagine his father explicitly told anyone to forget the time, drive slow, and arrive late. He was certain the opposite of that was as unlikely.

Mac felt Paul had to know things. First, the workplace. Its rhythms, diction, stress lines, black humor, prurient interests, fixations, ambitions, hopes, and dreams. Second, the industrial arts. The reason of maths. The motor control of drafting. The abstract architecture of bills of material. The blithe hyperbole of marketing. And the rigor of project control and accounting. Third, backbone and adversity. Apparently Paul was light several layers of cheap, mass-manufactured Tanine scar tissue.

"Oy, shite bucket, yer in my seat then, aren’t you. Piss off before I snap your nob off.

Paul looked up. He was tired. The boy standing over him was four inches taller, at least. Paul looked around. He had no friends nearby. The boy could say otherwise. He was lanky and stood like his body was trying to be insulting. Hair uncut. Smelly, battered work clothes. Paul didn't know who this guy was.

He knew the cracked wooden box he was sitting on was nobody's. In fact, it occurred to him that he might actually have the strongest claim to it of anyone. How could he convey the total magnitude of the amount the boy didn't matter in a non-confrontational way? How does one indicate that one owns essentially everything on both sides of the Clyde, including said stupid box? How do people talk to cross-eyed idiots who could go fuck themselves?

This kind of distracted internal stem-winding was generally not Paul's friend. He hadn't been in a lot of situations like this one. He didn't know what to do. It was just another thing that being alone on an unfriendly factory floor could potentially teach him. If he paid attention.

What did get Paul's attention was a mouth full of floor. A sharp knee in the back. And a single gravity-powered punch to the back of his head that made his nose bounce off the cement. Paul would wear a slight septum bend for the rest of his life without realizing how it had come about. He would assume rugby. He would be wrong.

Regardless, it didn't go well for him. He lost the box. Back at Dalzell House Paul ran from car to side entrance to an unused dark upper room. He said hello to no one. Ate no dinner. Fell asleep in a bloody shirt, crying. He was eleven.

Aalana patted his sleeping shoulder sympathetically on her midnight rambles. She was twelve. She couldn't help Paul, so she continued on her solitary picket-walking.

"
Downstairs Mac was in the study. He was conveying self-importance. Mac was not a man who cared snap for poorly dressed warehouse bullies with an unusual fondness for specific discarded boxes. Robert brought Mac up right. That bully would have lost teeth.

The fact was, Mac was proud to keep wages under control to the point that boys couldn't afford pants. He wouldn't have said as much to ninety-odd percent of the fancy people he knew. Or even to himself. That wasn’t the part he played. But he was.

Klade Huxley had no trouble seeing it. It worked for him. Klade was Mac's Chief of Staff, Majordomo, Operations Man, or whatever other way Mac chose to introduce him. Mac had never to his knowledge called him "Fixer" or "Leg Breaker". The night was young. There would be more acts with more introductions. It could happen.

Klade leaned on a high sideboard by Alexander Roux. Scotch, neat, waited for its moment. He ignored the room for his pipe. Unlike most people, Klade didn't feel the need to performatively demonstrate attentiveness to Mac. Nonetheless, he paid attention.

Four years ago he was a plant supervisor at Weir north of Glasgow. The Spring Klade joined House Tanine he had batted down two union actions and elected an unlovable convenor against all odds. At the same time he saw off an attempted blackmailer who was undermining the position of a weak link in an interlocking directorate wrapped around Glasgow's throat, in a fashion not unlike that of the City Bank, pre-collapse. Mac had preferred to crack that weak link on his own anvil at his own time, thank you very much. For his efforts Klade was eligible to seemingly not pay attention.

"Sir, the plant is running fit to burst. We’re flat out. I have three shifts working. We've got boilermakers and blacksmiths up in arms. I'm doing everything I can to keep a lid on it. My staff are falling out and my assistant's begun day-drinking.

The manager speaking was Bob Kneely. Bob ran a wire rope and cable manufacturer majority-owned by a Tanine Holdings company. It turned over only about a million pounds. Much more importantly, Bob's eldest, Stone Kneely, had recently married the Lord Provost's youngest. On top of that Stone was the editor on the city desk at the Glasgow Herald. The owner of which was, in the main, George Outram, son of Joseph Outram, one of Robert Tanine's former managers at the Clyde Ironworks. But also, fractionally, though wheels and pulleys, Mac Tanine, to the tune of about five percent.

Klade kept it all straight. Mac called the strategy. Klade rounded up Bob. Softened him up for the meeting. He had brokered Mac’s buy-in at the Herald. His people were riling up the union to put pressure on Bob. And he made sure Mac's wedding gift to the groom, which he had purchased for Mac himself, was just the kind of long gun you would want to be seen with if you were the newest member of the Lord Provost's family joining in on the annual Boxing Day hunt. If a fox needed to be procured to make the gift of a gun play, Klade would happily snap his fingers.

"Easy there, Bob. I know you're doing everything you can. I'm sure you'll be able to make it work. You have a little time yet. Persevere, man!

Bob looked abashed and eager. More than a fifty-nine-year-old senior manager ideally should. Mac said a few more words. Gave Bob to know that he was a busy man and so should Bob be. Bob felt the breeze and turned to the door. Ushered out efficiently by Klade, who deftly signaled Rees Morgan, the head butler, his cue in the production before rejoining Mac in the study. They knew their lines well. Untroubled by delivery. The next scene would begin soon.

Up in the small dark room where only Aalana knew he was Paul twitched in his sleep. He dreamed of a day. That day he would hold the River Clyde in one hand like a bullwhip. The other hand would cradle the peak of Ben Nevis. Scotland would bow low.

"   High in the misty Highlands,
"   Out by the purple islands,
"   Brave are the hearts that beat
"   Beneath Scottish skies.

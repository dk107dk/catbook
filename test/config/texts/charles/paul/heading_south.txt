>1968 - Paul escapes to Fellfall on the Longsleddale

Aalunae Chesterian hadn't seen Paul in years. Charles hadn't seen Paul in longer. Paul hadn't been in Kendal since almost his earliest memories. Getting to Kendal from Motherwell was a simple journey. Less than two hundred miles. They were miles full of beautiful landscapes, coach sandwiches, and ginger beer. Paul was more than happy to go.

How Paul actually left Motherwell was less simple. It was new and different and odd. There was rain, so he hitched a ride from one of the help. It was Friday. The last weeks of the school year. Paul would start his senior year after the summer. When they didn't stop outside the school Paul was at first just curious.

"Your mum said you're to head to your grandma's for a bit.

The driver was an under butler's apprentice named James Lochann. Paul barely knew him.

"What, now?

Paul wanted Jimmy to pull over and explain. Young Jimmy was a good driver. He took his hands off the wheel to hand back a large parcel.

"Have a look here. She gives you this. Said you can buy what else you need when you get there. The tickets are on top.

This was quite odd. Very cloak and dagger. Paul and Aalana accepted that their mum was peculiar. Inexplicable, even. However, she reserved unusualness as her personal preserve. For her children she arranged the world to be, if not predictable, at least comprehensible. While not especially her strength, she deployed Rees and his staff to make it happen.

"Why didn't she tell me I was to go? How long? Why me? Is it because of the fights with my Da?

Paul had been scrapping with Mac a lot since the mill accident. It was wearing. His father was avoiding him. Rees avoided conversation with either of them. There were whispers among the staff. Klade was absent. Aalana was four-square on Paul's side. Unfortunately, she was not an army.

Paul had told his mum his side of the story. And what he wished for the mill workers. He declared that he refused to take more random company assignments. Aalasha was sympathetic. She was glad he was sticking to his guns. However, her engagement was oblique, at best, and she was frequently just not around.

Jimmy was noncommittal. He made a head shake that conveyed partly:

"Who knows?

And partly:

"Why not just have a look?

Paul opened the package. It was about eight or ten inches thick. Less than two-foot-long. Canvas with two buckles. Basically, a duffel. Two train tickets on top. Along with two letters. One addressed to him, one to Aalunae. The one to him was open. The other, sealed. Paul set the symbology of that aside.

|Gilly. Don't be mad about the sudden trip. Look at it as an adventure. It will do you good to have a breather from this place. And your grandparents are head over heels that you're going to visit. I grabbed a few things for you. But mostly just take what's in the wallet and get what you need. If you want to return sooner, or on a later day, just trade the ticket at the station. Or call anytime and we can send a car.
|Give my love to Luna and Bora.
|Lots of love, Mum.

The wallet was brand new. It contained a lot. Hundreds of pounds. That was new. Paul never carried much money. Why would he? There was always a car, a minder, or a room nearby full of managers.

Jimmy pulled them to a stop at the station.

"Put it together kid. Time to go live your life of adventure.

Paul stuffed the ticket south in his pocket. Everything else went back in the bag. He jumped out.

"Does Lana know where I am?

Jimmy looked away.

"I'm not sure. Want me to tell her when I see her?

"Do you have a pencil?

Paul pulled out Aalasha's envelope and removed the note. He scribbled something quick on the inside, sealed it and handed it to Jimmy.

"Give it to her when no one is around, Ok?

Jimmy gave a half mock salute and spun a bit as he pulled off.

"
The trip down to Kendal was uneventful. He bought snacks. Changed at Carlisle. Arrived on time. The station was empty. He found his way to the street. A man in a worn and paint-splattered work jacket leaned on a vehicle. He waved Paul over.

"Hullo there. Are you Paul?

Paul waved and came across.

"I'm Paul Tanine. I'm here to visit my grandparents. The Chesterians. Are you with them?

The man straightened up, brushed curly hair out of his eyes, and opened the driver's side of the battered delivery run-about. It looked like it had been rescued from a bankrupt dairy farm. It had been.

"Aye, lad. I work for 'em. Name's Luca Brenting. Jump in.

They drove through town. Over the River Kent. Up to the factory on a lane off Low Fellside. It was probably a five-minute drive. During that expanse of time, Luca talked. Paul learned about Luca's hound pulling down a grouse with suspected fowl pox. That Luca did a fix on his carburetor that just might have saved him ten pounds. He learned that a certain kitchen inspector about town could bloody well take a long walk off a high crag. And he learned about Luca's daughter's A-Levels in maths. It was a fun ride.

Luca pulled off the road and jumped out into the lane. The Fellsman's factory was a number of adjoining buildings that were appended one on the next over hundreds of years. It began when the land on that side of the village was just a handful of hill farms.

When Charles came into the business, he and Aalunae had begun renovating. They expanded the company's workspace and grew the business. A couple decades later, the lane was bright and full of activity. The factory buildings were painted and tidy. It was a miniature manufacturing works with a quaintness that was disarming. The effect was not at all Tanine-like.

Luca grabbed Paul's bag and led him in. The first kitchen was two largish rooms for prep and cooking, and several storerooms, packaging, and cleaning spaces. It was hot and overpoweringly minty. They threaded their way through the break room and a small courtyard. Luca was looking for Aalunae. Employees called hello and waved them on. They found her in a loft doing things.

"Oy, Boss, your new trainee is arrived!

Aalunae got down off a stepladder. She moved quickly, fluidly. Spun around and grabbed Paul in a bear hug.

"What a treat, Paul. I'm so glad you're here! Why, look at yer. Grown so much so soon.

Aalunae had seen Paul last many years before in Motherwell. She had visited Aalasha less than a handful of times. While Aalasha increasingly found solace in her mum, she was embarrassed for Aalunae to see the ways of House Tanine, as the original disapproval still smarted. Aalunae had never enjoyed the formality-rich surrounds and was, moreover, not eager to discomfit her daughter. The relationship progressed from bristling energy to supportive rapprochement to lethargic resignation.

Paul hadn't been anywhere much lately, let alone as far as Kendal.  For years Mac had organized his doings as part of his vocational education. Paul had only been to Kendal twice. For Easter, one year. The other visit was a foggy memory. It had been a long time. Everything was new.

"It's good to see you too, Granma Luna. You look well. This place is humming!

They found their way to an office. It was empty. There was a desk with some officey things. Paul guessed Charles held court there.

"Where is Granpa Bora?

Aalunae looked at Luca. He shook his head slightly.

"Probably at the house. This place can be noisy. You've never seen the farm, yet, have you? We'll fix that later this afternoon.

Charles and Aalunae had purchased a small farm up Longsleddale way sometime after Paul's last visit. Charles had been slowly gathering pasture land in that area for years before the move. They rented the house in town to borders. They rented most of the pasture land to herders. The main focus was the mint cake factory. Any side income was of course welcome.

"Luca, take our new lad and get him kitted out for hard labor.

Aalunae winked. Paul had been expecting to be put to work. The idea of being useful among family made him happy.

"We'll head up to the farm for a bite and such in a few hours.

The farm was even more rural than Kendal itself. The road winding out of the village up the River Sprint was increasingly hemmed in by five-foot dry-stack walls. The walls were ancient. Thick moss and lichen. By the mouth of the valley, the road was reduced to a single lane. Cars, trucks, and carts were rare. In the case of vehicles meeting, oftentimes one party would be forced to backtrack to a field gate to pull over. There were small stone bridges. Trees were scarce, having been cleared untold ages ago. The fells rising above were wild with scrub.

Above Sadgill, a village so small calling it a village seemed like charity, a creek meandered down from the high ground. It passed a small cluster of buildings on its way to the Sprint. This was the farm. It was called Fellfall.

Fellfall was a rustic fieldstone and slate main house of two stories. A newer semidetached stucco- and clapboard wing to the right. A large barn stood in good repair. A one-room cottage at the end of the drive. Standing beside that, a shack-like shed, hives and a chicken coop.

A retired farmer, Lottie Merbecke, let the new wing. She raised lambs and helped with the chores. A young artist occupied the cottage some summers. So far, his checks had not bounced. Likely in part because they were very small. He was good-natured but withdrawn. A pair of enthusiastic herd dogs ran about.

Aalunae drove a bright blue Austin pickup. It was nearly as old as Paul and had many more miles. She and the truck disagreed on the speed of the trip. Its engine had a lot to say. Aalunae talked over it. By the time they pulled up, Paul was up to date on twenty years of the Chesterians' evolution into the semblance of a modern farm family.

Aalunae told the story in a breezy way. In reality, most of her time was still in the Fellsmans factory. Luna and Bora didn't need to play farmers. Just the opposite, it took them away from their business. The farm was just a fun adventure, if occasionally annoying. Paul soon decided it was a kind of scruffy luxury item. Completely unrecognizable as such. He loved it instantly.

Fellfall's two hundred acres ran up the dale to the west of the River Sprint. Its boundary ran along the dale, notionally, over Shipman Knotts, Goat Scar, and Raven Craig. There was no enclosure wall exactly on the line at top. What markers there were had not been well recorded and maintained over the centuries.

This was the far end of Longsleddale. Lower pastures were green but narrow. The untrammeled slopes drew closer and closer to the river as you proceeded north. About a mile and a half beyond, the valley tailed off. Charles and Aalunae's land ran up to the wall of Steel Rigg across from Tarn Craig.

Longsleddale was seven or eight miles long and sparsely populated. Fellfall was the last farm. The wider east side of the dale was worked by a farm half a mile below. Charles was quick to talk down the fertility of his land. The relative infertility of its fallow upper slopes was in large part how they were able to afford to own so much of it.

Had Charles been asked, why move so far up Longsleddale? Almost ten miles from the factory. Why buy a farm saddled with so much marginal land? Why a farm at all, given the several generations since his forebears were last farmers? He would probably have rambled. Charles didn't ramble much. You might have heard about fell-walking, quiet, birding, a little income from the land, and other hobbies. They say if a person answers a question with three or more reasons, none of them are the truth.

Aalunae had a small room over the office on Stony Lane. In a production crunch, she occasionally camped there. Charles only occupied the factory office two or three times a week. The paying of bills and sending of invoices happened at Fellfall. The hectoring of suppliers, buying of equipment, sales negotiations, and the cold calling prospects happened in town. His green Bedford pickup huddled next to the Austin in the farmyard.

"Hello, what have we here? It's good to see you, Paul. You've grown!

Paul knew Charles by sight. He hadn't changed a bit. They hugged. The elder Chesterians were huggers. Tanines were mostly not.

"Grampa! It is so good to see you.

Charles was done with the preliminaries. Paul had no luggage to speak of.

"Let's go check out the barn. Perhaps Lottie has some dinner fixings for us, eh.

Lottie did. A fresh butchered pork roast in the raw. They tramped back in. Kicked mud off shoes. Started cooking dinner. As they worked, tea and biscuits. Charles and Aalunae didn’t worry about spoiling appetites. Paul chopped vegetables. Aalunae chopped the roast. Charles pretended to be useful. His pretense fooled Paul. The conversation managed to be both sporadic and flowing. Having arrived, it was like Paul had never left. That was the way of Fellfall.

Aalunae had received the letter from her daughter. While Paul and Charles were negotiating for a dinner cut with Lottie she read it. There were three brief pages, along with several exhibits. Pressed flowers. A thin yarn demonstrating the |UOOO/UUUOO| of Norwegian |nålebinding|. A |scherenschnitte| bookmark. Aalunae put it away. She pondered what Aalasha communicated as they made dinner. Over mint berry ice cream she asked.

"How are your parents?

Aalunae had refrained from asking all day. Paul didn't really notice her not asking until the moment she did. Charles didn't look especially interested. Paul wouldn't have expected him to. There was an undercurrent of skepticism both north and south of Hadrian’s Wall. Paul and Aalana being closer to their mum, felt both sides. Paul was, of course, in Kendal to get some distance.

"Mum's alright. She's busy. You know, she has her preoccupations. The gardens, especially. She seems rather more preoccupied if anything. It's hard to tell with Mum, but I think she could be happier.

Aalunae could imagine. She wondered how Mac was.

"Well, I'll say he's fine. A bit of a bother these days. The steel industry's apparently about to come apart like a Christmas cracker. It's all dinner parties Lana and me can't get out of, and meetings we can't disturb. Although the past few weeks he hasn't wanted me at the dinner parties, so that's alright. Suits me. I'm not complaining.

He was, though, in a way. Meanwhile, Charles's way of knowing stuff without obviously leaning in, and Aalunae's nodding interest in everything Paul, pulled him into a friendly game of conversational conkers. The upshot was predictable. He complained.

"The thing is, I feel like I've been interned in half the factories up and down the river and they're all the same. They chew the men up. Nobody tells me what people get paid. A few quid a week? I don't know. But they can't hardly afford shoes, some of them. We're in heavy industry, tool and die, manufactures. They mint money for us. But they can't afford good boots. And we don't even give 'em clogs. It's a wonder they have any toes left!

Now, some people would think this was an unfortunate remark. Somewhere in the back of his head Paul knew his grandfather had only eight toes remaining. In fact, he had been remembering Charles's nine fingers, even as he was not able to slow his young freight train mouth down, completely forgetting the more germane deficit. Charles, on the other hand, was amused. Partly because he thought Paul a bit self-righteous.

"Granma, imagine if you paid your workers so little their clothes were hand-me-downs full of holes? What would people say about you as an employer in the village?

This remark made Aalunae make a tight frown. She made sure her employees were well dressed. She didn't want talk. Nor did she want to save a few pounds a year by causing herself stress from employee angst. She thought that a poor business. It almost bothered her to hear the speculation, even as offhand and well-intentioned.

"My father's name is associated with poverty and danger. That is, if people even know his name. He hides behind Scottish history. Dalzell, Lanarkshire, Hamilton, Scotland. We're wrapped in the Saltire while we hire men to break themselves on the wheel.

Charles looked thoughtful. He played with an empty pipe. Charles had given up smoking years ago. He couldn't break himself of the actual pipe. His was clay. The bowl was intricate. A tartan tracery with riveted seams in black enamel.

"Yet he puts you into the factory floors, eh? Right in the danger, dirt, and dissent. That seems a rum way to bring up a company man!

Paul's face scrunched up.

"He's trying to toughen me up. I've heard him say it. It upsets Mum. I'm tired of fistfights and injuries. I want to be able to take it. I don't want to be soft and sheltered. But it's rot.

Paul paused.

"The office work's not much better. They mostly don't tell anyone who I am. Which is good, I guess. It's scut work, bad attitude, and my family is the butt of jokes.

The Chesterians were still. Paul continued.

"The boys in the offices take the mickey out of the men on the line. But they are scared of them too. And scared to show it to the managers. Everyone's afraid of getting fired, or looking soft, like a pansy. They are soft, though. They wouldn't last an hour on the line.

Paul's voice hinted of a little pride, a little scorn, both weighed down by weariness.

Charles tapped his pipe. He agreed with Aalasha. Paul needed to be right where he was. At this point, another might have tried to say something insightful. He did not. Instead, Aalunae reentered the room with mint tea. Good for sleeping. Her way of putting the men on notice. There was work in the morning. It wouldn't do to lay it all out the first night with half a week to Saturday.

The summer days were long. There was often fog. Paul learned to drive the Austin.

A pattern emerged. Three days to town. Two for the farm. The villagers soon stopped noticing him. The workers soon took Paul as one of them. The dogs soon found other things to follow. Weeks passed. Paul assimilated better than most. Strangers didn't easily enter Kendal and its valleys. Soon enough, though, another stranger arrived to give it a go. That one was the opposite of family.

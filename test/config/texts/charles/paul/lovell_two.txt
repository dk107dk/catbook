At the Jodrell Bank research grant award party that Paul hadn't been invited to he had had a couple of drinks. Cheap blush and blanc. He was not especially used to drinking. Social drinks seemed to go with the job. The job at hand changed moment by moment.

First, the job had been mingling. The Head of Sales of Karabiner Industries was a good mingler. A cheery party guest who was amusing to talk to, if unfortunately insufficiently scientific. Then he had played CEO of Karabiner. This role was unfortunately combined with that of young Paul Tanine, son of his father, an old "friend" of the Director. Despite his unannounced visit, the Director was glad to see him, or so he said. But he wasn't buying anything.

"Give my best to your father. He is always welcome here.

Not a fruitful conversation.

However, Paul's most recent conversation had been shaping up brilliantly. His take on See See was that she looked a bit on the young side. Almost twenty is a long country mile from what he guessed was sixteen or seventeen. He was running his own company. By the skin of his teeth, true. And granted, with just one employee, who wasn't him, and just two shareholders, one of whom was. But they were in the black. Making rent and hanging on. See See, by contrast, was doing physics A-Levels. And yet, he couldn't look away.

On top of that, the name Athair rang a foggy bell.

"I run a small company. We make steel scaffolding. Here, have a logo sticker for your book. Are you doing an internship here?

Paul was being generous in his question. There was wishful thinking.

"No, I just live here. More or less. My parents basically never leave. The scientists work weird hours so there are cots, showers, and vending machines in the crypts.

Crypts? Paul was still working on the sharpening up thing. If it had been a game show someone else would have hit the buzzer already.

"Your parents are scientists?

See See realized they had gotten to that point. If Paul knew anything about Jodrell, she would change status in his eyes. That could be Ok, or not. Hard to say. If Paul didn't know anything, that wouldn't necessarily be better. Anyway, she thought, perhaps they had the same problem: parents that cast long shadows.

"My dad is Professor Phaeton Athair. He is the Director of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Theory Group. He used to be Chair for Astrophysics. It's kind of his baby. He helped Lovell build it back when there was nothing here.

She gestured to the Lovell Telescope, now cooling in the dusk. Numerous lights pointed at it. It was so enormous the illumination was not entirely successful.

Paul's eye's widened. This was the daughter of the person he probably should have managed to see before attempting the Director. See See entered, as she guessed she would, new territory. Paul had to quickly decide if she was a possible conduit to someone who might be able to help him. Or, alternatively, if she was a cool person he really wanted to know. He was leaning strongly towards the latter.

At that moment, a person entered the room. She did to the air what Paul had done to the glass door. He no longer had to ponder how his relationship to See See needed to change. Sadly, he was out of time.

"See See, common. It's time to go. We have things to do.

The radio tech pushed apologetically past See See's mom, Zolacur√©e Athair. He was returning in haste. Cori stood by the door. Her foot tapped virtually. See See dropped her physics book on top of the PDP-11 manual, stuck the Karabiner logo inside, grabbed her pencils and protractor, and scampered cheerfully. She was pretty sure nobody would miss the manual. She was positive that if anyone did, they wouldn't think of her. She liked the logo.

"See you later.

Paul just stood there. Mouth slightly open. The tech pushed him aside.

When Paul left the control room shortly after, See See and Cori were already out of sight. He realized he was done. He left the building.

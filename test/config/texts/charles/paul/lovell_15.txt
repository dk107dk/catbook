Charles and Paul had become inseparable over Paul's summer exile. With Aalunae, they put their backs into the business and into the unraveling of the Artifact. The former progressed more than the latter. However, by the end of Paul's exile in Cumbria they had hazy plans.

Being a Tanine, and therefore not bound by the usual laws of procedure, Paul only returned home in October. His last school year had long started. He had learned far more in the field. Charles and Aalunae enthusiastically endorsed him figuring out life without relying on school. Mac enthusiastically used the time to prepare a new manipulative plan for Paul. Aalasha liked the idea of Paul being anywhere he was unlikely to be killed, maimed, or subsumed into the Tanine version of |homo economicus|.

Eventually, though, the prodigal son returned. Aalana was glad to be less in the spotlight. Although, she had begun college and dating, so she was already at a distance. Paul missed her camaraderie. Dalzell House was cold after Fellfall. It looked to be a long winter.

Perhaps that emptiness helped Mac almost immediately get his hooks into Paul. Mac was a hard-driving optimist. He was used to getting what he wanted. Having been difficult growing up himself, he liked Paul's fight, at least in principle. Mac was one of those people who quote whoever it was who said young conservatives are heartless and old socialists are stupid. He didn't say it exactly like that. Mac figured he'd mold Paul yet. He was more successful more quickly than he expected.

The plot was simple: Mac suggested Paul rehab a castle. He said it was a good way to get a little walking around money. He would be his own boss. It would be good for the community. Mac even implied that a successfully rehabbed Cadzow Castle might end up as his keep someday. Paul liked the first, discounted the second, warmed to the third, and internally scoffed at the fourth. Most importantly, though, the storyline fit with schemes cooked up in the Chesterian kitchen.

School was even more marginalized. A flurry of meetings commenced. They were closely preceded by Rees personally dragging Paul through the best haberdashers in Glasgow. It was also preceded by Klade strategically twisting arms behind the scenes. John Morrison Burns and Clare Anne Brown, leaders of the Cadzow Preservation Association and the Lanarkshire Historical Society, respectively, were frequently at Dalzell House over the next few months.

The first stage was just to stabilize Cadzow Castle. The Castle was falling down. Slowly being eaten by vegetation, and the spray paint, condoms, and needles of wasted youth. If Cadzow could be uncovered and stabilized, grants and charity could possibly be found to go further. They might reconstruct it sufficiently to add it to the attractions drawing visitors to the former Hamilton environs. If it worked, heritage would be preserved for the future. Jobs created. The sunshine hoisted into the sky.

Paul liked the stabilization idea. Manufacturing historic sites for appreciative middle-classes sat better than manufacturing industrial inputs on the broken backs of the working poor. But a full rehab was daunting. Beyond that, he sniffed an opportunity that might scaffold a whole new direction in life for him. At his father's expense, no less. And since Paul was almost done with high school, he could easily take a gap year.

Paul's role was central. Mac, along with a few other grandees prevailable, funded the Association's project. Paul, joined up as the face of Tanine. He would run the operation out of a limited liability company: Cadzow Construction Associates, Ltd. Mac instructed Klade to stand well back, but equally to ascertain Paul would not fail.

On completion of the work, the Castle's upkeep would be contracted out to a company that Klade had persuaded to do the property maintenance at cost. In return for its contributions, due public attention and a sizable tax benefit. Of course Tanine Holdings had taken a not insignificant ownership stake in the management company. And of course, this was not widely known. Paul already assumed that kind of thing. He didn't care.

Now, Paul liked all these arrangements quite well. He made an arrangement of his own. In the background Paul retained his own solicitor in Glasgow. A scrambler from outside Tanine circles. Paul had him set up a limited liability company on the down-low. Now all Paul needed was a partner with knowledge and loyalty who was, with respect to the castle scheme, an unknown quantity. He knew just the person.

As the project got into gear, Paul hired a team to remove the growth and excavate the grounds. He hired masons to rebuild low outer walls and field stone stairways. A heavy construction company resurfaced the ancient roadway below and the more recent private drive above. Electricians ran power to the site. Engineers tested the soil for stability and support. This was all according to the sponsors’ expectations.

Every week Paul typed up a brief status memo. He did it on an IBM Selectric. A print shop duplicated it. It came back in a string-bound cardboard box. Paul addressed and stuffed twenty envelopes by hand. Rees directed them to the post. Email and Word would have been so much simpler. Sadly, they were unavailable then. Years later Paul's offspring would roll their eyes comically.

Every other week the sponsors met at Dalzell House to review progress. That summer Aalana began helping to create the agenda. She ran the meetings crisply and captured the minutes. At Aalana’s direction, Rees had the refreshments catered. She quickly expanded her role to handle the weekly status memo, too. Paul put her on hourly. She loved it. It was an early taste of her future favorite sport: board wrangling.

Two months in, Paul hired a consultant from Ayrshire to design a reinforcing foundation and multistory brace for the castle wall. The consultant recommended extensive steel scaffolding. Railing, transom, ladders. Horizontal and transverse bracing. Mounting kits and galvanized tie bars. Toeboards and sole boards. Helical piers and bearing plates. A serious amount of hardware.

A tall, long, curve-hugging scaffold with the heft to stabilize a castle is a building project unto itself. The exterior north side was three stories of more than four-foot-thick walls built of four-hundred pound blocks at the edge of a gorge. An intimidating prospect. This was the opportunity Paul had been counting on.

Paul insisted on handling all purchasing and contracts negotiations himself. The consultant handed Paul the requirements. Paul did due diligence as to the acquisition. Which is to say, Paul handed off the bill of materials to Craig Chester Burns. Craig was the young man whose life Paul had saved just before his sojourn in Cumbria. The young man who had coincidentally been named for Charles Chesterian. A fourth-generation steel man himself. Who better to help build a massive iron and steel scaffolding?

However, Craig wasn't a part of the project. He was the sole employee of Paul's new company. And it was Paul's company, operated by Craig, that leased Cadzow Construction all it needed for the build. Craig procured the highest quality scaffolding. Significantly more than the project actually required. The markup was eye-watering. Calling it fraud wouldn't have been crazy-talk. They walked a fine line. Happily, for quite some time nobody noticed. When finally someone did, there was too much face to lose for anyone to kick up a fuss. Paul got away with it.

And that was the start of Karabiner Industries. The fulcrum Paul intended to use to lever the World. Why Karabiner? Because Paul was sure that now he was climbing a crag without a net.

DONE        >> Charles sees the moon -- lunae -- low on the horizon from wrengel seeming to call him south.

DONE        >> in Aalunae's death scene Aalunae's terminating Martine's pregnancy isn't obvious
DONE        >> charles and aalunae decide to hide the artifact from aalasha because they are afraid of it. why afraid -- pick a reason probably before the blowup in London.
DONE        >> Mac is never around. in the pricking fingers scene she is covering for him. this is part of her withdrawing and becoming hostile
DONE        >> even more clear that she lives in a fantacy world growing up
DONE        >> a gentle nudge on self harm and dangerous behavior in the Emerld Princess using the poisionous plants in her basket?
DONE        >> fix the plant communication aside. see Ruby note.
NOT DOING   >> Aalasha fits Mac because: educated woman, a botanist, from a successful industrious family who can boss the help, pick the right flowers, and looks stunning on his arm. but actually she used herbal magic to overwhelm his pheromones, leaving all that as reasons, but not causes.
DONE        >> more about/at Aalunae terminating her pregnancy due to an absent father -- foreshadowing Aalasha not doing so ^^^^

DONE        >> Why does he have an affinity for Roseafey?
DONE        >> see code.txt. ruby note: You mention it a few pages later, but it feels odd for Klade not to touch on Charles and Roseafey without immediately mentioning that she killed Aalunae three years prior in 1985 (especially given that is where readers last saw Roseafey). Surely Aalasha would have reacted terribly to her mother being murdered, an emotional response that Klade, close to Mac, would have witnessed as well? Does he find her response more tempered than expected, or the opposite?
DONE        >> Work his origin a bit more to foreshadow that he'll play a bigger role
DONE        >> Klade has three orgin stories -- one w/roseafey, two w/mac. in the first w/ Roseafey, see his fear of failure and punishment

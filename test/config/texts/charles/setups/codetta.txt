A story

Most families lose track of their members after a few generations. Mine doesn't. Most people don't meet their great great grandfather. I did. Long ago. His name was Charles.

I find myself with time on my hands. Someday I hope to be busy. Today I cannot be. Doing nothing is boring. With a little artistic license, I can try to fix that.

My family's story isn't about me. I'm not important. At least – I hope – I'm not important |yet|.

However much you may think you already know of it, most of our story is long gone. And yet much is also, oddly, not. That makes the story something like history. History is told, they say, by the winners. Given my circumstances, that seems like a bit of a contradiction. The sources of contradictions can be interesting.

My name is Echo. This is not my story. Everything I tell you is exactly true.

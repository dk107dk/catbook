>A future

What heights are these? A great family torn apart. Its next generation back on their heels, muscles straining. Everything in motion. Little explained. No certainties.

Such is life. Zoom out enough, though, and the chaotic simplifies. It rhymes, echos, and repeats. Zoom out further and humanity becomes a regular heartbeat. Atomically precise time crystals, the heat-powered pulse of Planet Earth, and the grand sweep of the Perseus Arm are alike in this: at some magnification, they all move. At the right magnification, they tell stories. So far from the material, I can only hope to get the focal length close to right.

All that to say, yes, of course, there is much more to our story. There is a right time for all things. When that time comes, I'll embellish, fabricate, and assassinate various people's characters ruthlessly to see if I can keep your attention.

>1991 - Another death in Dalzell House

Arbery Carfrae, Klade's Chief of Security, was big man who after more than twenty years doing what he did didn't often feel sick. He made an exception that day. Handkerchief over his face he stepped quickly into the hall. Looked for the man who had said he was going to find area fans. That was an urgent mission.

At this scene nobody was questioning Arbery's credentials or authorization. All had other things on their minds. Throughout the great house officials and experts were lost, preoccupied, and in fear for their health. Arbery was no better off. It was an estranging milieu.

The air in the room was all but visible. There was pollen. There was dust, or something like it. Insects? Probably. It all floated in the beams of the halogen work lights. The lights stabbed the ceiling and heated the air. The hot air was the worse for its unknown contents and their assumed relationship to the body. Heat and particulate aside, describing the atmosphere as rank would have been ingratiating to horror.

Mackintosh Ioan Tanine had been there a while. Several days at least. Spreadeagled. He was bloated, punctured and had leaked extensively. His situation was hard to describe forensically. Arbery had seen something similar once in a fancy garden, or was it a museum? What was the word? The word was espalier. The man's body was unnaturally warped and twisted. He was broken on organic wheels.

The body was inflated with biologicals to the point of rupture. A topiary mass bound on an espalier rack made of living hardwood. Black walnut arm-like boughs seemingly taken root in the box spring crawled out of his back having smashed through the ribcage. The gnarled arms grappled the body into the form of a Lion Rampant. Golden bamboo spears, rooted in the stomach, rushed at the ceiling at millimeters per hour. Oriole Azalea erupted through his gasping mouth in aggressive full bloom. The horticultural specialists brought in would work weeks to catalog the explosion of hostile biology.

Multiple professionals exposed much film. Arbery's handkerchief clogged and drooled. He sweated. His head ached. His notebook smeared. He persevered, fascinated. Everyone who entered tried not to fall. This crime scene was like nothing in Arbery's ken. Nor anyone else. It was in every aspect something completely new.

While looking like a boulder with sharp edges, Arbery was observant and imaginative. He noticed the heraldic pose. Noted that the royal red bedspread contrasted with the azaleas. Saw the Yellow Trumpet Vine grown stranglingly tight around the legs. He got the point without knowing all the names. He missed that the darker meter-long branches rooted in the brainstem and penetrating the room through Mac's eye sockets were a Kentucky Yellowwood. That would come out later. As would the composition of the plethora of cryptogamae. Nevertheless, it was clear: yellow on red.

Arbery had a sense of gallows humor. Yellow on red ruled out suicide. Mac would have been annoyed to die the Norwegian inverse of the Scottish Lion.

Arbery also gave a grim internal hat-tip to his adversary. It was inventive, outrageous, and overwhelmingly effective. A powerful statement. God, the power! If it – what ever |it| was – killed everyone who entered the room it would almost be worth it. He felt sick but at the same time wide awake.

The semi-reclusive Lady Dalzell had been down at the station for hours. She and the Head of House, Rees Morgan, had found the body on returning home after a fortnight in Kendal dealing with matters of her parent's estate. Her English solicitors, Fellsman's Mint Cakes employees, Rees, and many others had been with her all but constantly.

Aalasha had given no indication of shock or horror. Neither was her alibi weak. Nor could anyone explain how the murder weapon was wielded. That she was the estranged spouse, and was alarmingly horticulturally oriented, did not advance the case to anyone's satisfaction. She was free to go. No, she would not leave town. What part of the massive Dalzell House she had repaired to wasn't known.

If Arbery wasn't wrong, the botanical calligrapher wasn't just signing her name. There was too much structure, content, and intention. Perhaps, just perhaps, the hand couldn't help itself. There was a terrible danger in that.

Klade hadn't been wrong. It was well past time Arbery too got out of Motherwell.

"
Thirty-five feet closer to the stars Aalasha leaned out of a top floor dormer window. She could feel the waves of fear, hostility, and bafflement from the authorities below. It would be some time before Dalzell House returned to its stately silence. Nonetheless, return it would. A five-hundred year old castle built on the ruins of conflicts past does not so easily give in to the concerns of modernity.

She felt cold. In so many ways. She would not give in either.

She was facing north. Bora was north. She was sure she knew exactly where. Aalasha worried that others might also know, or suspect, or suspect she knew. This was an interesting puzzle. Why had he gone into hiding? Why were Mac and Klade involved? Beyond the accomplices to manslaughter, who had actually killed Luna?

Her children were distant. Doubtless they were involved in Bora's exile in some way. She at least knew why they had not involved her. She was self aware enough to know she was seen by them as, at the least, challenging and unpredictable. Indeed, even dangerous. She didn't disagree. Perhaps that could change?

And in turn, she had not involved her children in the crescendo two flights below. Could she explain? Would they understand?

First, though, the Lady Dalzell knew she had a monumental and urgent task. It would require skills and kinds of subtlety she felt she did not possess. House Tanine was now hers. How to take possession? How to disenfranchise the vanished but legally embedded Klade? How to find out what was going on? How to find and protect Bora? And how to begin a new life? So many things!

"I will need your help. Are you with me?

Of course she had known he was there. How she knew, he never understood. Rees stepped into the room's slightly lighter shadows. A clear, beautiful, but cold night was wrapped around Aalasha.

"Of course, my lady. Need it even be said?

Aalasha smiled. Somehow life would get better.

"None of that my lady stuff, Rees. We have much work to do to fix this mess. Its time to take control of life. We can chart a new course. There is so much to learn.

"I am ready, er...

He faltered in an uncharacteristic way. To Aalasha, this was new.

"Dalzell? Perhaps madam? I assume your grace would be out of the question?

Aalasha laughed at him, not unkindly. Laughing, at this point in life, also felt new. She hoped she would become better at it.

"How about Lasha? Perhaps you could start by getting my daughter on the phone. Wherever she is. We'll need Lana's worldliness, I think. I'm for sure in over my head. And we have an empire to overturn. She probably knows how.

She continued in a thoughtful voice.

"Perhaps it will be fun?

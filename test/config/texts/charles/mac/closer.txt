"What is wrong with me?

A panicky feeling was growing in Mac, one unused to the word. He felt exposed. The house was too quiet. Gargoyles haunted him. He heard echos. In a castle one has to appreciate echos. Mac was becoming autophobic. The echos weren't helping.

The light was wrong. It was the strange greenish tint of a brooding storm on the heath. Worse, the air. It was thickening, damp, and earthy. The backs of his hands itched. His throat closed.

Mac found he couldn't tell the time. So he demanded lunches, dinners, soirees, and tobacco tastings. The strain showed on his face. His laughter was sharp and clipped. He was a solo host with saccharine conviviality not moderated by confidence or an accompanist practiced in social graces. The guests all left too soon. The invitations soured. Still, a few came because Mac was House Tanine. Chit-chat faded quickly. The guests stayed less and less long. They came, they fled. It was painful.

By winter the lights of Dalzell House were, by and large, out before ten p.m., even at the start of the weekends. By contrast Mac's third floor Empire Suite, containing his office, private smoking room, study and master bedroom, blazed more brightly than ever. The lights burned all though the night. Was there a greenish shade? Mac's eyes grew hollow. At three a.m. he would startle to wakefulness, breathless. Could he really have been tossing and turning so long, since when? Wake and sleep were toying with him.

The staff were scarce. The maids were invisible. The under butler, Lochann, soundless, if ever present on that wing. Old Cranstan Sinnelly, Mac's senior accountant took ill and begged a prolonged abatement. Klade was overseas or on inspection, otherwise occupied on some such. Rees found reasons to remain north of the ceremonial rooms of the Keep. His haunts, the guest and service quarters. Mac's Executive Secretary, a drawn man named Brown, arrived at nine and left at five. His health and his assistant, Maria, faded. There rose quiet in the stillness. The clocks ticked relentlessly.

At about this time there was a noticeable increase in greenery in the Keep, and concomitantly an increase in temperature. Mac noticed new vines snaking up the stony vaults. Dark flowering beauties lined the second floor salon balustrades. Dwarf temperate fruit wrapped in bright poisonous colors nestled between pillars, in nooks, near fires. Reeds and grasses in oriental vases. Oxidized copper planters proliferated on copper chains. A ten-foot evergreen yew bound on an iron espalier silhouette of a menacing Kali Mata simply appeared one day in the entrance hall. While the colors were notionally Christmasy, it was not at all festive.

Rees took it all in stride.

On Boxing Day Mac and Aalasha found their way down opposite stairs into the formal dining room for the expected late breakfast. Candles, baby's breath, and rum pudding. A tradition long since rendered moot by the departure of the children, the death by an unknown illness of Mac's mother, Mary Ann Tanine, the unexplained absence of Clare Tanine, Mac's younger sister, and the slow shrinking of staff and service. Presents were reduced to hollow decorations. The brittle room was still and warm.

"Darling, happy Saint Stephen's Day.

Mac had not slept well. Aalasha's chill greeting didn't make him feel welcome.

"It is not like the old days, is it? The house is over quiet. We need music. Or something.

As ever, Mac engaged the interaction at a brusque angle of attack. However, unusually he trailed off, his tone uncharacteristically reflective. Subdued. Not himself. Aalasha was not put out by it.

"Mmmm.

She looked expectant. Standing. Waiting.

"So, how are the children?

Having once seized it, Mac appeared to wish to pass the conversational torch. Aalasha noted he said |the| children, not |our| children. Aalasha noticed things like that.

"Aalana and Paul are well. Clare we have not heard from.

Mac was looking down at the table. Insensitive to his incomprehensible sister's relegation to the category of children. He stood stiffly behind the master chair. Hands such that its back couldn't possibly collapse, even were the joinery to suddenly fail. He was staring at the bouquet in silk ribbons by the dessert spoon. There was one at each setting. It was not tradition, to his memory, yet there was something familiar.

What caught his eye was a slightest hint of pale green sifting off the leaves. Pollen or spores, of some sort. That ever pervasive color. He reached to loosen his collar. It was warm and the air. His fingernails were only very slightly tinted the same gray lime. The water he spit in the morning sink, the same pale shade. He reached to the nearest sprig and poked at the dust. It smeared into the fine cloth. His skin prickled.

Mac needed the room to be filled with people talking. He needed cool air, and dry. He needed all the holly, yue, gypsophila, and poinsettias gone. He needed breakfast champaign and harpsichord. Lackeys and the attentions of bootlickers. Company men and compliant family members. A carving knife and something to carve. He needed the echo in his head silent. And, especially, no one looking at him as if he were a specimen mounted stained on a slide.

Mac could have none of those things. He turned abruptly. Cringing in a Christmas prolapse, he withdrew back to his echoy chambers and watering eyes. He took aspirin, barbiturates, and double scotch. It was a long gray anxious day above the Clyde. The walls trembled. The glass panes shook. The night that followed was far worse.

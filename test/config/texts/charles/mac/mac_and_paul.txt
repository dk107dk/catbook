Mac followed Rees to Paul. The house was large and inexplicable, even to those with long tenure. Rees could have said, "Young Master is in the Ceylon Suite" and leave Mac to make his own way. Or he could lead the way and be sure Mac actually arrived.

They left the second-floor study, came downstairs to the entrance hall, threaded their way through the saloon and library, mounted the front tower stairs, rose six turns to the third floor, and traversed to a large guest room overlooking the gardens. Like most rooms at Dalzell House it was ordinate, well furnished, and lying in wait unused. In the rush on Paul's arrival from the infirmary, Rees had picked it at random from the many such.

"Thank you, Rees.

Mac turned his back on Rees and opened his eyes wide to Paul.

"Paul, my son. You are looking well. How do you feel?

Paul was not well. He felt uncomfortable and woozy. He didn't know exactly why. It was because the Tanine's family physician, an old-school gentleman by the name of Doctor Mason Le Breton, had slipped him a Laudanum mickey a few hours earlier. He wasn't enjoying it. On top of which, the pain was returning. The discomfort that made him feel less prepared for a bout with his father quixotically wound him up for exactly that.

"Not great. Right awful, really. It’s not just the bruises this time.

Mac ignored the last part. Paul was being pointed. His run-ins with heavy objects at his practicum assignments were already a thing. Sharp objects too. And sharp language. Aalasha's fury over what she saw as a kind of child abuse had reached the point of boiling over. It was forcing her into a world she attempted to avoid at all costs: reality.

Mac and Aalasha had had words. Often. In anticipation, when Paul came home with a shiner or a cut, Mac would become instantly irate. Likewise, when the car pulled away late in the evening as a door slammed, Aalasha's pulse leaped into her temples. Paul was caught in the middle. He felt like a servile robot being force-trained to avoid fistfights, heavy equipment, and domestic strife. Despite and because of all this, Mac was determined to be cheery.

"Well, you've done the family proud, son. It isn't everyone who can think and move fast enough to save a man's life. Most people wouldn't have even tried.

Paul could feel the adrenaline rising. He was learning to override his impulses. He didn't realize that his body preparing to fight was doing far more for him than the dilute opiates ever could have. That would have interested him. Had he known.

"Yeah, well I shouldn't have needed to. And anyway, probably more people than you think would have done the same. It's not like I stopped to weigh the pros and cons.

Mac knew where this was going. He didn't have time for it. Still, useful asset had dropped in his lap. If he could make it work, he would use it.

"No, true enough. But you are still a hero for acting without thinking. A right proper Scottish gentleman with nerves of Tanine steel! I'm proud of you. I will tell the world what a lion lives at Dalzell House.

Paul worked hard to make the expression he thought he'd have if Marmy walked in with hot Earl Grey tea in a rose cup with milk and three cubes of sugar. Four cubes would be better. And cream.

"That's fine, and thank you. I'd prefer not the notoriety though. Honestly, that's all.

He gathered himself and forged ahead.

"There's something much more important. The Works is putting workers at risk. We're hurting people, Father. We have to do something about that. It is important. The way they live. The danger they are in. You have to go see what it's like there, on the floor. This was worse than anything I'd seen before.

Paul got it out in a rush. He didn't think it would go over well. He was, right at that moment, simply glad his voice didn't shake, and he didn't run out of breath. He was getting better at this. Perhaps someday he would have an argument – an important one, like in Parliament, a lecture hall with hundreds of scholars, or a board room or something – where he didn't worry about how he was doing. That was the thing, he was always worried about how he was performing. So much that he not only didn't perform well but sometimes even completely forgot his lines. It was a problem. When he was young, he had been better, freer, unself-conscious. Where had that gone? He could barely remember. Just that things had been better. It was always sunnier then. He had been carefree. What had changed? And...

Paul suddenly realized he was doing it again. Mac was saying something important that he should be hearing. He realized he had to focus and engage if he wanted to make a difference. Apparently, Mac had stopped beating about the bush. He wanted something. Of course! He was getting down to it.

"...you have the ability to speak for the family, the Works, the whole industry. It is a power – a brief shining power – you can use at a critical time. You know what the stakes are son. You know what we're facing. You've heard the men talk at our table. In our drawing room and library. This is big. It changes everything and we have to get in front of it. And you have made for yourself a platform. For a few heroic moments, the world is listening to you.

His father's face was animated. Perhaps more than Paul ever remembered. He continued.

"The Labour fanatics are going to break Scotland. They are taking down all we achieved. For our country and the people. They will break it, tear it down, and redistribute it to people who don't know what they have. Who can't see the bright future we all want. And who can't help take us there.

Mac was on a tear. It wasn't that he didn't see how little his oratory was getting through to Paul. Or, at least, how little was having the desired effect. But he couldn't stop.

"And it's not us they'll hurt. It's themselves. Do you want them to have happy, carefree lives? Well, so do I. Just think of the same men on the dole. Think of the children with no future, no jobs, no food on the table, no boxing day festivities, no great educational institutes, no museums, no clean streets. They’ll have nothing. That's what's at stake. Everything!

Mac stopped abruptly. His heart was in good shape. However, it wasn't surrounded by the fittest flesh. The flesh was out of breath. It had to pause. At that same moment, Paul lost it.

"What are you saying? They're dying, man! Dying for Christ's sake! Your workers don't have a future because you're killing them! Your bloody companies with all their fancy fronts, their big cars, their expensive suits. It's on the backs of broken old men and burned children.

Paul's eyes glared. He was off the pillow.

"The men can't breathe. They have blazing metal coming at them from all sides. Choking. Chemical burns. Crushed limbs. And for what? It a buggering nightmare of absolute shite. For bloody pennies per hour while we have all this? It is unfair and unjust! It’s fucking wrong!

Mac and Paul were red-faced. Paul felt sick and dizzy. Mac grabbed a heavy leather-bound there-for-show first edition of something from the desk beside him and threw it against the wall. It crashed with a thud that knocked a daguerreotype of a silver-haired Dale Alistair Tanine, wearing an unbloodied uniform of the Scots Guards and medals, no doubt unearned. The heavy frame gouged the floor in a shatter of glass.

"Enough!

Mac stormed out of the room, slamming the mahogany door so hard its latch couldn’t catch. Paul could hear his angry tread all the way down two flights of marble stairs.

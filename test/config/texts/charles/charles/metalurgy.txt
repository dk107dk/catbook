On a day in 1919, Charles found himself in motion. On balance, his sensory inputs seemed favorable. He sampled the light and noted the temperature. Vibrations, humidity, the time of day, and the speed of Scotland flying past his eyes. He felt alert, watchful.

Since his return from the Arctic, he had become an even more careful sensor. A twilight in the cold could put him right back to huddling on the calcified sea waiting for the day the sun didn't rise. Too much wind at night and he heard the clunk of iced rigging and the snap of dangerous icefall.

Now, however, the nearly new coach was warm. The soft plush and luminous wood trim. That, and the frantic clatter made up for the gray trees, dead grass, and Scottish slag. His belly was full of long-wise sliced cucumber sandwiches. Fingers sticky with ginger beer. Physically, he was satisfied.

Perhaps more importantly, Charles was at a crux. His mind was spinning. Was he going to leave the land and the light again for the cold and unknown? He had not decided. Not being sure if he was going to join a new adventure was exciting. He vibrated with more uncertainty and nervous energy than is usual for passengers on the three p.m. Caledonian to Glasgow. Especially those in a first-class carriage paid for by others.

His patron was once again the leader of an on-the-make exploration syndicate out of Canada. The same sometimes antagonist, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, was working his hooks into Charles. Stefansson was determined that Charles should discover what modern metallurgy could offer to the challenge of keeping an icebound ship afloat. Charles cared deeply about that topic. He found himself unexpectedly ready to tramp off to Clydeside. The beautiful valley littered with blackened ironworks, mine tailings, and heavy manufacturers was expecting him. His way was paved by awkward gentleman's club introductions.

In 1919 the rich land south of Glasgow was rife with global influence, industry, and poverty. Hope strove against company store prices, fifteen-hour days, debt, and bone-breaking work. The many great houses were lit brightly behind mortared parameter walls with wrought gates on winding drives. The streets leading to them were cobbled. They quickly gave way to aggregate and then to mud. Village roads lined with clinkers and paved with horse manure.

Hot blast furnaces, forge drop hammers, and steam generators sang to the river. Tram tracks and wires for electricity and the telephone had crept up the turnpikes and were slowly fanning into the dark corners. Trucking routes reached further out from the city center each year. Carters hauled the materials of the Empire. They backhauled coal, steel rolls, heavy equipment, and castings to the shipyards and armories attempting to backfill ebbing Pax Britannica. Every corner pole advertised strikes, union rallies, deaths, opportunities, great causes and their great champions.

Charles would lodge for five days at the Royal Hotel in Brandon Street, Motherwell. Arriving he was to ask for Bobby Brown at the desk, a never-met man who would help with the arrangements. That evening he would sup at the hotel with another new contact, Stonny Fieldwell, a foreman at the gas works who would make the introduction of Charles to experts in metalwork and machinery.

Friday Charles was to head back to Glasgow. He would make awkward small talk with possible underwriters and gentlemen scientists. Monday Charles would start meeting shipwrights and outfitters in the river yards. All going well, he would learn much about steel and iron hull strengthening, cold weather treatments, weight-saving casting techniques, and modern high-pressure naval engines. All this in twelve postpaid days funded by the Exploratory Committee. Returning south, Charles would write up a report with recommendations and await instructions. He pondered what he might do if he got the nod.

Brown, Royal's manager, fixed Charles in a fourth-floor two-room suite on the front. He sent Charles with the bellhop who raised the curtains, switched on the gas, and took a tip. Brown had tea and biscuits and the papers run up.

Charles took notes in the margins of the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry while chewing through the biscuits, shaking his head at how out of his depth he was. For the anticipatory buzz of enthusiasm and dread brought on by proximity to adventures, he was happy to play the fool on matters of science and engineering. Whatever leadership and money required, he was game. After dinner he slept fitfully.

"
At six-thirty the next morning, Stonny talked incessantly. Charles answered briefly when needed. They walked half a mile to a materials lab annexed to a modestly large factory specializing in drop forge and press work.

The lab was a two-story workspace with a high loft at the back. It had been converted from a slaughterhouse. Massive floor beams of discolored oak ran laterally supporting several large rust-colored half-inch iron plate slabs spaced five feet apart in two rows. One slab supported a mostly assembled coal cutting apparatus. Its chain gleamed with heavy oil. Another had a pipe bending press with work in progress. A trolley beam held one end of a heavy framework that stretched across half the space, with the other end bolted to a hinge fixed to one of a number of long narrow iron reinforcement plates bolted to the brick at intervals between and around the tall windows.

There were tools, hardware, wires, and parts bins under large hanging electric lamps. Mini furnace and sinks. Drafting tables and drawing trays. The lab smelled like a cross between a smithy, a chemist, and a gymnasium. The factory's shift change was deadened by the thick walls. The benches were still empty. A silhouette far at the back under a window was attacking a block of pig iron with a massive hand-crank double pinion shoulder drill.

"Oy! Good day Cay!

Cayton Burns head turned and the pig crashed to the table scattering iron shrapnel. He leaped back cursing as the pig tumbled off the table and rang the floor like a muffled bell. A big spur snapped off the pig as it came to rest.

"Here, man, this is Mister Charles Chesterian, you should ken him, assuming you han't already met.

Stonny didn't seem to notice Cayton's troubles.

"Cayton. Call me Charlie, if you like. Good to know you.

Charles held out a hand to Cay. Cay's hands were obviously not clean.

"Likewise, well met.

The big man glared at Stonny.

"Stonny you radge, called out at the perfect moment, didn't you. Nearly cost me my foot.

Stonny was distracted by a barn swallow up in the rafters at the end of the long room.

"Eh, failing means yer playin. Look, Charlie here is an arctic explorer after knowledge of how to keep his ships afloat using modern materials. Mr. Jefferies thought of you for an explanation of how we temper.

Cayton became all business.

"If you're looking for a hardy Martensite, I might be able to help. What is your requirement?

Charles, hearing an expert offer help, was in his element.

"I need an ice blade that won't fracture for two winters of ramming multiyear ice, and trusses and plating for an ice belt that won't buckle under unusual point or global loading.

Cayton looked at him blankly for a few seconds. Laid down the shoulder drill, took off his gloves and apron, and turned towards the door.

"We're going to need mugs of cofaidh for this.

Charles liked the way he did that. He was glad for the help. He followed.

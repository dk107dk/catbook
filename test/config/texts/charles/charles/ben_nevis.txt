>1991 - Charles at Ben Nevis, Svalbard, Norway

"I have become an arctic explorer, again. Finally.

Time passed. The |Phénakisticope| of life turns ponderously in the arctic. What grows grows so slowly. What feeds looks long for food. What sleeps sleeps deep. So far north, the sun's grander biannual project smooths out quotidian day-night cycles. The heavens sway languidly. With little else not rock or ice, time slumps down discouraged. Unmoored from time, motion slows, the temperature drops.

Down Raudfjorden, northern Svalbard, the Buchananhalvøya peninsula runs across the Klinckowströmfjorden from the foothills of Ben Nevis. The mountain always has snow. The lower reaches near the ocean briefly melt out in cool humid nightless summers. It was late August. Soon the snow would return. A little after that, the long night would roll inexorably south over the peaks of Haakon VII Land.

Who was Charles Chesterian to embrace this place? An explorer, an engineer, a father, and a grandfather. He had lived his best years in the wild. Also his worst.

On that day he stared at the last light creeping up the rugged Fryst Alberts Topp. He thought about the names of things and of nameless things. A land named for the king. A mountain for a foreign prince. His new home named in echoing Scottish imperial arrogance. All of it was at its core no more, no less, than ancient rock and ice. Human pride was but a little thing.

This was his land, now. Stones, glaciers, moraines tumbling chaotically onto a wide alluvial plain. A windy land carved through with cliff walls that climbed up to ridges. Land that had not so distantly been thrust up from the sea in a jagged line of nature's own rampant pride. Destined to be worn down by time.

He slid his unlucky hand deep into a crack in a seam of subzero granite. He leaned at a dizzying angle over nothing. His joints stretched plastically as his major muscle groups refused gravity. He was perhaps ageless. Perhaps unmoored from future and past. Either way, the land was isolated and patient. It waited on little things. Perhaps a human sound. A sound that might throw itself against rocks much older and more stiff than he.

Charles shouted into the void in the most human way he knew how. Out there new generations struggled for meaning in their lives by struggling to preserve his. Meaning felt distant. It was but a little thing.

Meanwhile, he was a simple man. Hungry. Tired. He hadn't figured it all out yet. Light was fading. The long night nearly arrived would bring with it even longer days to come.

When Cayton Burns was still an energetic lad with a home-hewed haircut he believed he would do great things. His mum, May Burns, encouraged this line of thinking. The great things they believed were coming lacked specifics. Young Cay had few models for great.

His father, Buck, did not have the answers. He was not the model of great. He was, however, a great dad. He worked hard, long hours, including Saturdays, to put food on the table and pennies in Cay's pocket. To get those pennies, Cay followed Buck to work on the weekends. He worked under Buck's direction. As he worked, he learned skills that would prepare him. If not for greatness, at least for being one of the lucky few who are in the room when greatness appears.

The workshop was quiet. There was seldom anyone else there. Weekend work was common, just not in the design shop. Clyde Engineered Metals was progressive, at least in its treatment of its highly skilled R&D engineers. They worked a fifty-five-hour week in five eleven-hour shifts. Shifts that often felt like fourteen hours or more because they often were. Buck had a key to the heavy rolling door. He relished quiet days for his own experiments. His love of metallurgy still alive, even after many, many years.

There was an upright Mills piano in the shop. It sat in a sunny corner, covered in metal shavings and dust. A note glued to the back said it was a wedding present from William Mills, pianoforte maker of Coatsbridge, to Jacob Tanner, metal bender of Motherwell. The piano was largely unused. How it found its way into the shop, who could say? Buck suspected perhaps because its iron frame was no longer stock.

Buck had shown Cay his way around the console years ago. It was an attempt to keep him occupied and out of harm’s way. Even years later, Cay had still often spent a few minutes working the keys on Saturday morning before joining his dad for work at the bench. Quiet scales. He discovered harmonic chord progressions. Hanging minors. No doubt peculiar sounds to one skilled in the art. That was certainly not Buck. He was absorbed with the work at hand. Forming and bashing metals. That was enough music for him.

"
Twenty-five years gone, the world had progressed. Now, Cay worked alone on the precious day, ear protection on. Buck was retired. Worn out and near deaf. Cay was determined to not go that way. Consequently, it was some minutes before he heard inexpert hands on the piano. The tuning had suffered. He came over.

"Welcome back Charles. I didn't know you played.

Charles looked up. The music stopped.

"My daughter taught me a few things. Lasha can tell a story using anything. Good to see you. I brought your favorite.

Cay's eyes lit up. Charles handed him a blue carton of Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cakes, chocolate covered.

"Children are a wonder. My boy Kendal is about somewhere. Thank you for these. Do you mind?

He cracked the box, not waiting for an answer. Unwrapped one of the bars. Took a huge bite. Waved Charles over to his bench.

"Heaven! Comearr and habe a look at this alloy. Something new.

Cay swallowed and pointed.

"This here is bloody hard. And light. Best we’ve created yet. I'm not supposed to say what the constituent materials are.

He gestured at the bench. Charles could guess exactly what the constituent materials were from labels written in clear block letters. He smiled. It was a gesture, not an opportunity. Cay knew Charles was not one skilled in the art.

"Cay, I know what you have here is good. You wouldn't say it otherwise. What I said in the letter is here with me. Let me show you. I guess it may not be as tough as whatever that is. But I'm not a betting man.

While Charles talked, he dismounted a long leather tube strapped to his back. Cay would have guessed blueprints. Now he could see the burden on the straps wasn't that. Charles wasn't a small man. Clearly, his shoulders were sore.

Cay wiped the chocolate from his hands. Squared himself, ready to receive a heavy weight that Charles had not relinquished even to play piano in a near-deserted workshop. Cay took the case carefully, gently. He unconsciously contradicted Charles's confidence in the content's strength.

"Let's have us a look.

Cay turned around to an empty bench. Laid the case out. Unbuckled the end cap. Inside was blackness. He reached in and felt the insubstantial smoothness. Gripped it and pulled. His hand came out unexpectedly empty. Surprised, he looked up at Charles.

Charles just looked back. He observed Cay's everything slow down in disrupted thought. He had seen that look before.

"Perhaps you had better.

Charles agreed.

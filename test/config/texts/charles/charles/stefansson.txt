1910 - Charles heads north of Alaska

Vilhjalmur Stefansson was born William Stephenson in 1879. He was a Canadian of Icelandic descent. Stefansson would eventually fetch up in Harvard robes dressed in an exotic name and accent that wasn't the blend of Iowa, North Dakota, and Cambridge knowing listeners might have expected. He wore strikingly inappropriate Inuit bone slit ice goggles on the podium at commencement in the first year he lectured on the common arctictarity of the northern indigenous. Stefansson was on his way to becoming a serious explorer that still cared about haircuts and tailoring. Not coming from means, haircuts, tailoring, and arresting bone eyewear were important to his large-scale ambitions.

Charles Chesterian was provisionally seconded to Stefansson on the say-so of Royal Navy confidants of patrons of the National Geographic backing the Canadian Arctic Expedition, planned for 1913. He first met Vilhjalmur in 1910 in Portsmouth, England. It was the weekend before Charles boarded a Weather Service schooner to circumnavigate Iceland. A shake-down cruise for Naval officer candidates bound for cold weather postings. Charles was in awe. Stefansson was thirteen years senior. He was much more worldly. Charles didn't stutter. But neither did he speak freely.

After that short cruise, Charles didn't see Stefansson again until he finally reached Esquimalt Royal Naval Dockyard on the far side of North America two years later. In the meantime, as an Engineering and Stores Officer for one of the Expedition's seven ships, he prepared. Stefansson made introductions. Charles worked with dozens of veteran arctic expeditioners by post, cable, and in person.

The former Chief Engineer of the |Nimrod|, Henry Dunlop, tempered his expectations of machines and metals. Walter Wellman, in the middle of his campaign to take his airship |America| from Spitzbergen to the Pole, offered logistics advice, and purchasing and shipping contacts. Wellman spoke well of Charles to John Longyear, founder of an arctic coal mining company. Longyear introduced Charles to Evelyn Briggs Baldwin. Baldwin had accompanied Wellman on his earlier terrestrial attempts at the Pole, now estranged. All of these further introduced Charles to yet more experienced arctic hands.

The introductions to famous explorers, the piston pump of practical education, and the ever-expanding expectations for the young naval engineer to play an unremarked but pivotal role were heady and exhausting. The pay was terrible. The payoff, incalculable. And the risks were huge. Not just of failure. In the case of any failings, surely the risk was his own death, and the deaths of others. Existential risk was new and exciting.

Charles's observations had also sown hairline doubts. Stefansson, Wellman, Baldwin, and others in their circles were full of unreasonable beliefs, self-promotion, and political machinations. They were show dogs. Peacocks wrapped in furs and spiked boots. Big talkers that bludgeoned facts with pop science, questionable academics, and nationalist fervor. These personalities tossed out colorful words that piledrivered their views deep to support their ambitions and self-worth. They raised money hand over fist.

Charles stretched his meager Navy salary. He was circumspect by nature. Speaking seldom, and then only carefully. Charles listened well though. He learned the ways of explorers, theorizers, and leaders of men. Those ways he would not be adopting as his own.

There came a particular bitterly cold night on the deck of the |Karluk|, Charles's vessel, iced in north of Alaska. From outside the Gunroom, Charles could hear Captain Bartlett suppressing a ragged cough and speaking roughly. He hesitated, hand to the knob. He couldn't hear all the words. Stefansson's nasal voice sounded stressed but imperious. Other voices lower. Someone slammed a mug on the table. A chair kicked.

Charles turned himself quickly through a hard luff. He got close to the bulkhead and cocked his right ear to a porthole by the door. His hand fell to his side. He wasn't going in. The voices all seemed to be his superiors. More importantly, he was intensely curious. Placing himself as an actor in the play would make it harder for him to learn his lines. Charles quietly positioned himself in the small workspace behind the Gunroom.

It was clear Stefansson was interested in hunting. Bartlett and Will McKinlay, the expedition's magnetologist, argued against a sledge party. Strenuously. McKinlay argued for unity. Bartlett for leadership and morale. Stefansson for raw meat, a protection against scurvy and a way to stretch their provisions. Practical measures, he said. McKinlay fired back a charge of cowardliness. Another voice rejoined that incompetence in hunting had led to the diminution of the opportunity, ultimately putting the crew at risk. A heavy thunk. It could have been a weapon hitting the oak table. Or not. Charles read drama into the exchange.

Charles was quick to intuit subtext. As the son of a rector, he had had a master class in subtext, subterfuge, and self-delusion in the greetings following each mass. As a denizen of hidden spaces of church, refectory, and cloister, Charles had sharpened his intuition on subdued voices. As an officer, he had learned straightforwardness and clipped expression. In his head nuance remained.

Stefansson was not straightforward. He calculated and dissembled. Charles heard him yearning for solid land. For self-sufficiency. For surety. In one sense, he had an admirable confidence in his command of the boreal landscape. Just below that, a fear of death trapped by the deep sea ice.

Charles knew it right off. Stefansson would leave. He would return, if possible, but not without delay. In fact, absolutely with delay. Separating himself from the ship was precedented. Stefansson had dogged to Point Barrow from |Karluk's| first ice-in. In truth, Charles's sensitive intuition was hardly needed. Stefansson would obviously go, come what may.

With the expedition leader gone with five strong men, Charles's duties and visibility increased. The engine was silent. Bartlett put him to work on navigation calculations, as officer of the watch, overseeing the gang reinforcing the frame timbers, and other new responsibilities.

The weather worsened. The ice accelerated northwest. The shore party was abandoned by the elements, even as they had abandoned the ship. The same elements promoted Charles higher up the Wardroom table. And those again same elements would in due course ice-lash him with premature streaks of gray.

The overwinter grew uncertain. The stress in his head groaned in counterpoint to the pressure-strapped futtocks. He didn't have time to mull on the actions of people not present. Karluck was having a time it. Charles was just beginning his adventure on the ice.

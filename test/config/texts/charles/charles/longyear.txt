>1912 - Charles steps above his station in Boston, Massachusetts

"One hundred thousand Bostonians is a more frightening prospect than the same number of polar bears.

Internally Charles smiled. And yet, it was true.

About three thousand six hundred and fifty days after America fought Charles Chesterian's forebears to a standstill, he leaned forward on the forecastle deck and watched the mouth of Boston Harbor open. The American economy was multiples that of the United Kingdom, and on par with the whole British Empire. It could eat him alive.

Boston was full of industry, energy, and expectations. Charles arrived from Liverpool in a chilly spring on the Allan Line's twelve thousand-ton |Scandinavian|. An uncomfortable, but inexpensive, third-class passage. That was the furthest he had traveled. Like Boston, he was up and coming, disheveled and full of enthusiasm.

Charles debarked on Long Wharf, downtown. Trunk and bags in a cart. Briefcase and rucksack at hand. Imposing granite warehouses funneled passengers to muddy streets. Once fully into it, Boston had at least one comfort to Charles: It cocooned him. Brick and granite. Gravel, gas, and horse manure. No grand vista was possible in the cat's cradle of narrow waterfront streets.

Boston was as any growing seaport, fast and crowded. Every establishment was in its just-opened vigor or it was already going out of business. A stranger could quickly get lost. A tired stranger could lose his shirt. Charles found a cheap hotel and slept. Then a day and a half of introductions, purchasing contracts, and explorations.

On the third day, there was Commonwealth Ave. The avenue was something entirely different. A wide straight engineered mile lined with upscale townhouses and executive |pieds-Ã -terre|. Interspersed with these, great stone mansions and demi-palaces. Elegant carved-brick city homes of New England industrialists shouldered in. The city's leading hotels took several corners.

The Commonwealth Avenue mall was grand. Its central boulevard park. Benches, wrought iron gates, fountains, and elms. Its unbostonian flatness. A precise grade laid down on reclaimed land. Its nostalgic alphabetical cross streets. Crisp right angles with familiar English names: Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield, Gloucester. Its stalwart gas lamps, high arched arc lights, low pastel vault lights. Commonwealth felt like a dominion capital. One that didn't take orders from Europe.

The wealth and modernity made Charles's cuffs soft. His hands became aware that his gloves were just a bit too short. It was brisk out. Early evening. His coat was unfashionable. He was abashed by his surroundings and destination. Discomfort helped keep him warm.

395 Commonwealth Avenue was most comfortable welcoming carriages. More recently it had been accommodating saloons. By contrast, Charles took a hansom from the Boylston Street subway. He had wanted to see Boston's new tunnels, preceded only by those of London, Glasgow and Budapest. He got out with two long blocks to go.

Walking the last blocks calmed his mind. Charles was there to talk of the Canadian Arctic Expedition. Drinks and cigars. Grand houses were not his natural habitat, nor either his ambition. Calling on eminent strangers was not his thing. Deep breaths. Through the iron gate. He mounted the perron purposefully, stubbing his toe on the first riser.

Light was fading as he reached the entrance. A footman opened the outer door and pulled a chord in the vestibule. A deep copper bell, dimly heard. Crisp footsteps. The footman withdrew silently as a butler appeared at the inner door.

"Mister Chesterian. Please follow me.

A housekeeper took his coat and hat almost as he walked. Charles kept his attache.

A piano played several rooms off. Hardwood reflected electric lights. Tile and marble highlights. Lush drapery. An oriental-looking vase with glass flowers. Stained glass in the ceiling, dimly lit. A narrow |senneh| Persian carpet led to the stairs. The butler turned off it. Paused momentarily before a dark wooden door inlaid with lighter marqueterie and brass fittings.

"Masters Ayer and Longyear will see you in the Drawing Room.

Inside the air was warm. Fire filling a hearth of Saint Laurent and New England granite. Dark curtains, deep dark pile, polished African blackwood. The room was a cave, despite the high ceiling.

"Gentlemen. Mister Charles Chesterian.

The butler withdrew.

"Welcome. I am John Longyear. And this is Frederick Ayer, my business partner, and our host this evening.

John turned to a fourth person, younger, sitting in shadow with a cigar.

"Over here is Holger Beskyttersen. Holger is one of our minority partners in the Spitzbergen venture. Norwegian, from an industrious family. A geologist by training. A pack carrying, snowshoe wearing geologist.

Longyear and Ayer were not snowshoe-wearers. They were also not lightweights. The former was in resources and land. His interests were primarily in leasing royalties, not his own works. The latter was a magnate of woven manufactures and patent medicines.

Together they had founded the Arctic Coal Company. Based in Boston, it was centered on Longyear City on the Adventfjorden of Spitsbergen Island, the largest member of the Svalbard Archipelago. Spitsbergen was then the world's most remote inhabited arctic island. As an economically open, visa-free unincorporated territory of Norway, Spitsbergen's coal, fish, and whales were there for the taking. The gentlemen were deep in the process of learning how to efficiently attach that coal.

This much Charles knew: he was in Ayer's third and smallest mansion to learn as much as he could.

Charles's throat firmed up and he was suddenly impressed with the room's warmth. He spoke in a tight rush.

"A pleasure to meet you, gentlemen. I am honored. Mister Ayer, your home is magnificent. Mister Longyear, thank you for arranging for us to gather this evening. Vilhjalmur Stefansson was eager to share the expedition's plans with you. I am happy to do so. Mister Beskyttersen, I'm delighted.

Longyear nodded approvingly.

"Call me John. And Frederick will certainly respond to his given name. What will you drink? Brandy or scotch?

John moved to the decanters. Holger gestured to a club chair and offered a cigar. Charles demurred, but accepted a glass. John continued.

"How is Stefansson? I met him briefly in Montreal some years ago. I knew him to be committed to expanding knowledge. It seems he has become something of an organizer, yes? A genius for persistence that some might think irredeemable. I admit I admire the man.

Charles wasn't ready to lean back.

"I cannot claim to know him well, but his accomplishments are quite impressive. I am glad to be joining his party.

Holger spoke in clear but heavily accented English.

"You are new to the arctic world?

Charles knew he was by far the junior of all of them. Holger might have been ten years older. It seemed a gulf.

"I was given the opportunity to make two brief voyages north. To Iceland with the weather service on SV Pinmore, in January. Then higher up Norway with your country's Tordenskjold. Just a bit of experience to get the lubber out and learn cold weather. I am, still, I fear, a neophyte. But I hope a quick study.

John looked at Ayer.

"Ah, you visited our stomping ground. Very good.

Over the next three hours, they drank and smoked. Charles was unused to the quality. The brandy and congeniality of John gradually undid his stiffness and settled his nerves. Ayer said less. Clearly the more calculating of the two. Both were intensely interested. Holger seemed to be sizing up Charles, though that was undoubtedly true of all. He gave the appearance of being satisfied.

They spoke of arctic peoples, national interests, and geographic unknowns. Of steam versus gasoline versus oil. Of stores and equipment. Of the rough and tumble race to the pole. Of fraud and exaggeration. And of the limitless commercial opportunities.

Charles laid out maps and diagrams, lists of supplies, biographical information on the men heading north, and the many expenditures he was overseeing as Stores Officer for the |Karluk|. The questions were detailed and perceptive. Ayers and Longyear wanted facts. They questioned everything in a way that put Charles's back up at first. Over the hours he began to understand the depth of their enthusiasm. He became used to its expression in clipped American speech.

It was energizing and exhausting. Soon enough the night closed on ten o'clock. Charles was not a heavy drinker. Conversation slowed. Charles pulled his papers together. Had he made mistakes? It seemed not, but who could know? He would find out later.

Charles apologized for trespassing on their evening. Could he return for dinner the next night? That would not be possible, Charles was leaving Boston in the early morning on the Pullman west. When would Stefansson return east? Certainly, he would come share his adventure after its successful conclusion. The men were satisfied.

When Charles finally stumbled down the stairs to the street he was glad of the fresh air. The footman waved over a waiting carriage. Charles tumbled in gratefully.

"John looked to Ayer. A decent fellow.

Ayer looked thoughtful.

"Indeed.

John continued as if working the Sunday crossword.

"What do you call a young man who knows not what he is doing, but does it very well? I note he asked us for no contribution. Though we offered our support, nothing. Intriguing.

Ayer again was not to be drawn.

"Indeed.

John brought Holger into it.

"Well deep thinkers both. Come now, what do you make of it?

Holger looked up. He looked to the portrait of Ayer's ancestor hanging dimly above them.

"I think it was just so. Done by strategy.

Ayer nodded with equanimity. The thought seemed to amuse John.

"Ah, now there's a thought. I see it. He had a rough subtlety to him. To what end, would be interesting to know. Even more, I wonder whose strategy. Stefansson's? Or maybe his own? Yes? Now that is the question!

Indeed.

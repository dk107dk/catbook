>1988 - Charles's last letter from Fort William, Scotland

"Everything you or I ever attempt will die and degrade to brash ice and dreck.

It had been a cold spring, the way Charles remembered it. On the other hand, the way he remembered it, every season in Edinburgh was cold. William Speirs Bruce had expounded on a pub stool fo'c'sle exploring well-traveled growlers of Tennent's Dark through a pint glass for quite some time before he fetched up on a too familiar multi-year floe.

"Me, I have been offered my Trollope Box and disregarded for the description of a vast world.

Bruce looked down and made a small noise at his glass through a beard gone ragged. Either disgust, pro forma noise so rote it could only aspire to disgust, or just meaningless Scottish sound with no discernible semantics. At his blood alcohol level Charles couldn't tell. He had no idea what Bruce was talking about.

"Trollope? Box?

Bruce looked up. His face got very slightly harder. His red cheeks slightly more red.

"Anthony Trollope, you uneducated buffoon. It's your godforsaken deep little England and he's your sodding conservative curmudgeon. The man invents an entire world of Barsetshire. He also invents the Royal Mail Pillar Box. Which one do you recognize?

Charles was considering the non-polar non sequitur as if it might be thirsty. He could maybe stand it a pint.

"One of them took a decade of effort. The other, an afternoon and a couple of bogging committee meetings.

Finding his glass empty Charles had no excuse not to engage, if reluctantly.

"The man is a friend of yours? Family? Scottish, naturally?

Bruce ignored him. Charles wasn't making sense. Bruce seemed to have left the topic of arctic exploration. Charles consequently wasn't ready when the boom came across hard.

"My voyages on the Antarctick Ocean were scrupulously precise. Meticulous! We ascertained data of potentially priceless scientific character.

The burst of pride was self-gratifying. It blew flecks of foam across the tall unsteady table.

"My English so-called colleagues, by contrast, achieve what lasting value? They push men and dogs to die on the ice just to plant flags. Bloody idiots! Meanwhile my work is reduced to cataloging years-old materials while fighting for scraps handed down by English committees. The dogs fight before they are eaten.

Charles had even less of an idea what he was on about. He wasn't rising to the Scottish nationalist's bait. Both of them had been at the pub a bit too long. Both were tired. Bruce weak.

In six months – or had it been ten? – Bruce would be dead. Partly of exhaustion, partly pique, and partly just life. He had but one last voyage north left in him. Once more to Spitzbergen. He would leave in a shambles and return home an invalid.

"
Charles remembered a version of this bleary-eyed conversation as he licked the back of Bruce's head and pasted his seven and a half pence stamp upside down on a post card of the rugged peak of Ben Nevis. The stamp was one of several issued by the British Antarctic Territory. He had received the sheaf years ago, uncanceled, as collectables from a contact who did an overwinter. Charles had never been to the Southern Continent. Plenty of his Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cakes had.

On the back of the card he had written a note to Aalasha.

|Dearest, I wish you were with me for this little climb up Ben Nevis. I remember climbing with you when you were just twelve and I forty-one. I will plant a flag for you! Perhaps I could stop in Motherwell on the way home?
|Much love. Bora

Needless to say, Aalasha and Charles had not climbed Ben Nevis at twelve and forty-one. W. S. Bruce's name, along with that of his ship Scotia, was carefully not covered by the two other nondescript small denomination stamps crowding the back. Charles dropped the card in a red pillar box across the street from the train station. He walked alone up hill to a cab stand. He would begin his fated climb the day after next.

Aalasha, received Charles's card hours before she got word. Team CHRONOS hadn't wanted Charles to send it. Having been overruled, they had at least timed its arrival well.

Having grown up with bedtime tales of adventure, loads of books on distant lands, feats of endurance and heroic science by family and friends, Aalasha had had a good idea of what was coming. The inaccuracy of the note. The history of Bruce's ship Scotia, laid down in Norway. The irascible Scot's other doings, outside Antarctica, a place Charles had never been. The stamp that, while passing muster with the Royal Mail, was not appropriate to place. A father not given to chatty postcards. All clues as big as billboards.

A quick trip down to the first floor library told Aalasha everything she needed to know. She was ready for the news when it came. She took it hard, as she was entirely meant to be seen to do.

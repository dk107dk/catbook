Their four seats faced each other. It was a long car. They were in the middle. They didn't discuss where best to sit. It was obvious. This way they could exit either end with a running start. Had they discussed being chased off the train by persons unknown they would have no doubt felt sheepish.

They left Rockport Station before nine a.m. No one else boarded their car until Manchester-By-the-Sea. The platforms were nearly empty. The car was hot. It moved slowly and rocked noticeably on antiquated rails warped by fifty years of underinvestment. Each wondered if the others felt seasick. Typical Boston and Maine. No one spoke.

They got to North Station by late morning. Hungry, they hit McDonalds under the Causeway Street El. Paul ordered six plain hamburgers. Charles just fries. See See two apple pies and black coffee. Aalana a normal person's lunch. Paul did a construction project with his cheap burgers, combining them into two towers.

"You know you can get a Quarter Pounder or something, so you don't have to play with your food?

Aalana wasn't teasing. She wasn't coaching. The others were chewing seriously. Watching the exits. Paul swallowed a bite. Put his burger down. He took one of Charles's fries. Paul was aware of Quarter Pounders.

"Let's go over what we're doing again.

Charles studied a fry.

"Gunnarr is someone Gramps knows from long ago. We're going to meet him.

See See corrected Aalana.

"No Charles never met him, right dear?

See See treated Charles his age. She couldn't help it. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it seemed silly. The day before Charles had had a spell. Today he looked an energetic, if distracted, fifty-something. With Charles, you never knew what you were going to get.

"Right. You knew his father, Holger, yes?

Paul prompted Charles.

"Yes, that's right. I knew Holger long ago. I had just returned from the Northwest, on my way home. He was a good friend over the years, though we didn't spend much time together.

Aalana looked piercingly into Charles's eyes. He twitched inside. For a second it seemed Aalasha was there, then she was gone. So like her.

"You need something from him, Grampa, don't you? You said it's important. You need something. What is it? You're as tight as an Ipswitch clam.

Paul started on the second burger tower. He had a way of talking while eating that kept people from hating him for it.

"This has to do with the Artifact he told us about. And the present family strife. Mom, Dad, Granma Luna. Everything. I think we'd know more if we needed to. I think we're going to hear more soon. Do you mind, Granpa?

Paul had a serious look on his face as he stole another fry. See See was working on her second pie. She was not gentle. They applied themselves in silence. Then they left. Paul asked if anyone cared to walk over the hill to their appointment. That way avoiding the subway heat and the close quarters. See See took him up on it.

"If Granpa's up for it, I'm game. No crowds would be, mmm, better. Because.

She tailed off.

They headed up towards Staniford Street. The sun hit Boston’s brutalist edges hard. They observed the entrance to the Department of Mental Health at the Hurley Building, with its inadvisable trippy cement pahoehoe flows and hints of animal totems. The usual comments were made. Past the stone churches and flophouses on the cheap side of the hill. Crossed below the service end of the grand Statehouse complex. Up and around the corner of Mount Vernon. Across the somber, yet enthusiastically named, Joy Street.

At the top of Beacon Hill, they stepped deep into Brahman country. Blue blood stained the elmed streets. Sidewalk bricks were worn glass smooth in places. Many window panes still had ripples. Flowers and ivy smoothed away the impression as to brick or stone. Understated black ironwork became intricate. Cobbles. Streetlamps reverted to gas. There were no car alarms. No dogs. Few cars. It was still, dim green, hot, and steep. A terrarium for the power elite.

Louisburg Square was quietly inviting. A neat tree-lined private pocket park behind ironwork. Surrounded by thirty tall narrow elegant townhouses. Only about the size of Dalzell House's two courtyards put together. Yet, in terms of raw political economy, those thirty-odd families were within steps of every nook of hidden power worldwide. One of those families held sway in cold distant lands.

The group caught their breath at the corner of Mount Vernon and Willow. Each looking a different direction with purpose. They saw nothing. They cooled. They reminded themselves of what they needed to remember. They pushed expectations and insecurities aside.

A simple knock was sufficient. The bell seemed intrusive. A valet ushered them in.

"Master Beskyttersen will receive you in the Drawing Room on two.

He shepherded them into the elevator. It was cozy for four. The door shut. It ascended slowly and quietly, as is typical with residential lifts. By the time the door opened the valet was waiting on the parquet to show them in.

"Sir, your guests have arrived.

"Thank you, Edward. Please, some refreshments.

"At once.

Gunnarr was standing at floor-to-ceiling windows, facing them. His accent was subtle and multifaceted. The gauze privacy curtains were drawing behind him with a barely audible hum.

"Welcome, welcome. I'm Gunnarr. I'm so pleased to finally meet you.

They introduced themselves and chatted as sandwiches, biscuits, and tea were brought in. Gunnarr produced a large vintage photo album. Showed them pictures of his father and other family members. Also, Norwegian arctic scenes, boats, industry, houses. He watched Charles at first curiously. Increasingly with flashes of a peculiar expression. That despite he obviously intended to display no such thing. He watched Charles. Paul watched him.

Edward cleared the remains and withdrew, promising coffee shortly. The door closed with a solid muted clunk. An intentional sound. Gunnarr cleared his throat in the quiet.

"Now then. Let's talk about where we are, shall we? The doors are closed. We won't be disturbed unannounced. Tell me.

All eyes turned to Charles. His eyes remained entangled in the rug a moment. When he looked up, he was as much unlike the old man who struggled in the heat the day before as could be imagined. He channeled the grim determination that cut through the moment-to-moment noise of human adversity to the singular everlasting essence of pushing on through the cold.

"I need your help. We need your help. I can't tell you everything. Not yet. I can speak of circumstances and conditions. And I can give assurances you will believe. A partial story. Indeed, a presumptuous half-truth. Yet, what I can offer without specifics in return for your help may eventually mean more to you than you can imagine.

Gunnarr's eyes were wide. Pupils wider than required for the muted wall of light. Breath shallow. Voice subdued.

"Please continue.

Charles produced a manilla envelope. He deliberately unwounded the red string. The envelope contained two articles. A black and white six by nine photo. And a copper-colored chain with half a medallion attached.

"The photo is me with your father across town at South Union, his Kontor club. It is dated 1915. He signed the back. Please look.

Gunnarr reached for the photo. He looked. There, Charlies and his father. It was indeed Charles… Looking essentially the same as the man in front of him. He flipped it over. He opened his album and flipped to the middle. Extracted a photo and placed it face down beside Charles's. Even from feet away, See See could see the script matched.

It slowly hit everyone in the room. All knew it. All had wondered, mostly in their subconscious. Now it was unavoidably submitted into evidence. Charles was indisputably somewhere in his nineties. And yet looked younger and more fit than Gunnarr. Holger was decades dead in his eighties. Charles was inexplicitly not. Not remotely. No one spoke for a long time. Eyes did not meet.

With an effort, Gunnarr looked up, into Charles's eyes. His voice was dry.

"Can you explain? How do you...

His voice trailed off. Charles held up the necklace. Held it out to Gunnarr.

"First let me know that you recognize this.

Gunnarr pulled back. The hairs on Paul's neck twitched. He didn't know quite why. There was tension. Aalana looked at him quickly. Meanwhile, Gunnarr carefully draped the chain across his knee. He then proceeded to recapitulate Holger's methodical uncovering of his own half of the seal. Pulled it from his shirt. Held the two pieces together. Looked at both sides. Wonder on his face.

"You have half the Hanseatic Seal of the Bergen Kontor. I have had only half the story. Suppositions. I think I knew. But now this. You have this in your hand. And you are from another age. I am obliged. What do you need from me or my family?

Charles had to collect himself. He had rehearsed this moment.

"On my return from the wild, your father asked me to consider a job. I was in no condition, right then. Later on, I did a few things for him. Now I need to recall the favor. But first, if you like, I can tell you the tale I told Holger. You can judge then.

The coffee service arrived. Charles told the story at a level of detail even Paul had never heard. Charles gained strength, even as he burned energy in the telling. The heroic age. The pain. The mythical motivations. All but impossible to explain to people so deep into what would have been then, looking forward, an inconceivably magical future. He brought them up to the thirties. And then he stopped.

"All of that Holger knew. And of course, in some of it, he played a part. I shouldn't like to see every detail on the front page of the Globe. Nor would I imagine you would. Nevertheless, none is especially secret.

He paused. Considered their faces. All expectant. None showing fatigue. Himself, the somesthetic prickling was back in full force. The inside of his skin was more alive than ever.

"In 1932, years after my last expedition, I made the only real discovery I'll probably ever make. It was an object of unusual properties. I have not shared that discovery. At this time I do not think that would be advisable. Please do not ask for details. I cannot give them to you. I cannot say what, where, or how.

Charles paused again. He half-expected push-back, annoyance, some outburst. You could hear a pin drop.

"Instead, I submit myself. My physical self is proof that what I tell you, what I ask, is important. I have the notes from a complete examination done by a physician who had no knowledge of me. You are welcome to it.

Gunnarr took the folder offered. His eyes dipped briefly from Charles to the records.

"Now, let me make my ask. I want to disappear from the face of the earth.

Gunnarr started, eyes up, locked on Charles. Tentative understanding flushing across his face.

"Ah. Now I think I see. Yes? That, I can help with.

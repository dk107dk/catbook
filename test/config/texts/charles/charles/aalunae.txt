In 1916 Liverpool was full of war-making and match-fixing, electric lights, coal smoke, and cheap cuts of lean meat. Riots targeted shopkeepers of German descent. Prices everywhere rising fast. Bread limited, ale dear, sugar virtually nonexistent. Industrial jobs were plentiful, with pay surprisingly low. Labor spoiled to fight ownership. Volunteers spoiled to fight the Kaiser. Seamen were fatalistic. Women, exhausted. There was talk of rationing. There was talk of torpedoes. There was talk of gas.

Charles Chesterian arrived home from North America in a crush of immigrants, refugees, guest workers, and conscripts from across the Empire. He found cheap lodging and registered his presence with the Navy office. Collected his pension and disability. Surprised it was livable. He volunteered for duty but failed the physical. He walked with a lurch and his maimed grip hadn't yet regained sufficient vigor. He assumed it would someday. The cold burned when it was even a little cold. There was much he wished to forget.

Disregarding war, constant cross-Atlantic scientific controversy veered to character assassination. Of Cook versus Perry. Which had missed the Pole by more while claiming the most? Baldwin versus Ziegler. Additional to Baldwin's versus Wellman. And Wellman, newspaperman turned failed explorer, pivoted to starry-eyed polar airman, returned fire. Also by turns, providing stomach churning comic relief. He built a massive airship in the wasteland of Spitsbergen. It had flown ignominiously but a few miles. That scant years after he had caused death and disaster on the Greenland ice.

Despite all injuries done and indecorous behavior unbecoming, each of these, and many more such, were celebrated. They were awarded medals and honorary chairs. They spoke at dinners and argued in the press. Some were knighted. All this even as they raised new funds with false promises and exaggeration, wasted more lives, and threw knives at each others' backs. Charles looked away.

Men of commerce Charles met back in provisioning the expedition made quiet introductions. The Masons welcomed Charles. Liverpool's Grand Lodge helped him find his footing and loosened his frozen tongue. After a few meetings, Charles found work as a dockland warehouse supervisor. It was a fine use of his intuition of Britain's logistics machine.

Charles stiffly unlimbered into society even as he countersunk into a deep malaise. He stumped unlit streets late. His gait, while much improved, still raised eyebrows. Especially as stamina faded. Always hungry, yet strangely unable to find and finish a meal. Something was missing.

At the end of 1916, Charles moved impulsively to Manchester. He introduced himself to the grand lodge. Thence to Stanley Rigg, Chair for Geographical Sciences at Victoria University's Faculty of Technology. Rigg was quick to an appreciation. Soon Charles was proctoring lecture halls of aspiring naval engineers. His unusually practical knowledge of nautical apparatus, modern navigation techniques, cold lands survival and its effects on materiel, and a general sense, quickly given, of having made of the world a laboratory for the extreme exploration of failure modes combined to make his tutelage popular. Rigg kept him busy. Nevertheless, still something was missing.

1917 dwindled. There came a day when Charles realized it was time. A particularly dunderheaded cabal of geography candidates argued and declaimed. They were soon ignoring him and thrashing it out with each other. Behavior for the playing field, not a lecture hall. So much talk. Charles exited the building long before the bells rang. He wondered how such foolish youths would fair on the ice. He had been only a little older when the Kurlak began her drift. He had survived. Now his students would have to fend for themselves for half an hour.

Later that evening Charles found a ticket north to Cumbria in his hand. Found a seat in the smoky third carriage. Tipped his hat over his eyes. He slept. Woke after a change of trains in the small station outside Kirkby Kendal in the Lake District at half-past-ten on a chilly night. Charles paused on the platform. The trainâ€™s cough died away. He could finally breathe.

After taking his bearings, he found absolutely nothing had changed. His detour to this location five years earlier for Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cake and heavy K boots, specially made, had been inexplicable. Could it not have been handled through the mail? Perhaps. And now? It was quiet. Quiet could not be mailed.

He picked up his bag. Walked up a narrow road to a small kempt inn. Shortly Charles was asleep. In the morning over a country breakfast he admitted to himself why he was in Kendal. What he had been missing. A young woman with the unusual name of Aalunae Fellsman. They had had but three long conversations, short at least one conversation's worth of words. He had grown more reticent. Perhaps she now had more to say?

It was a long shot. A personal expedition with personal risk. It might have gone badly. It did not. By late 1918, Charles at last knew for certain he hadn't been wrong. He knew who could help him finally recover. As it turned out, he would be in quiet Kendal with Aalunae a very long time.

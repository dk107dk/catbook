>1916 - Charles carries a letter to Holger in Boston

When in Boston, Holger Beskyttersen was a finicky eater. He had been raised eating pickled herring, |fiskekaker|, |kjøttkaker| and the like. Like everywhere, Norway left its own deep imprint of place. As much as Holger had adopted Boston as his second home, Beantown staples didn't get it done.

Luckily, Downtown had more to offer. Holger had settled most often on lobster chow mien with lotus seed mooncakes and lichee preserves. His staff dialed up a variation from the Hong Far Low in Chinatown, several blocks away, rushed it through his club's side door, and slid it on warm china. With scalding jasmine tea. The kitchen kept a four-set of plain copper chopsticks handy.

Holger's small, exclusive Kontor Club was on the fifth floor of the granite grand concourse of South Union Station. The Club had views over the Dewey Square Elevated from its Smoking and Billiards rooms. The dining room looked out over the rail shed covering the platforms and tracks leading south and west out of the city. Few below knew what they were missing above.

Tides of executives and their secretaries, the professional classes, traveling salesmen, filial sons, and college students washed through the station daily. Hundreds of locomotives poured a treacly effluent up through vents, fans, ridge gaps, and cracked skylight panes. The Club's soundproofed windows were cleaned twice a day by a gang of scaffold boys who only appeared to wear black. Money and the want of it met on the platforms.

At that time, South Union was the largest and busiest train station in the world. With a Nordic Hansa-eye's Heraclitulian view of history, Holger anticipated a day when New York left Boston behind. New York's port was larger and deeper. Its manufacturing industries increasingly more dense. Its railroads closer to Washington and Chicago. Boston was, he thought, bound to become merely a hinterland. Nevertheless, taking that long view, he suspected that on the other side of decline would be another ascendancy. Such is the nature of the World. Nothing stays still long.

The Kontor's foyer was marble and granite. It had industrial brashness, finessed in black walnut, cherry, and oak. There were exposed structural iron accents and floor-to-ceiling windows with slim iron mullions. Aubusson carpets covered the dark wood. On the wall across from the entrance was a simply-framed design sketch for what would become John Dollman's A Very Gallant Gentleman. A scene of Lawrence Oates staggering to his death on the Ross Ice Shelf. Charles Chesterian, coming upon it unexpectedly, shivered involuntarily.

At the desk, an attendant took his coat and hat. Charles had borrowed a little against wages-due to purchase outerwear that he hoped wouldn't embarrass him in society. Though not entirely successful, he was ably aided in his goal by having shed a significant amount of giving a damn somewhere north of Nome. He asked for Holger and was led to him. Holger laid the Globe on the table and stood.

"Charles Chesterian, so good to see you. You look well. Indeed, well recovered. How was your trip up the coast?

Charles wasn't sure this was completely accurate. Still, the extra day in New York to stretch his legs after the long cross-country journey had helped. Holger's office had arranged everything. From the moment he stepped down at Penn Station to his elevator up to the club at the top of the head house in Boston. He traveled first class. That was new. A nice change.

Holger wore gray tones. An air of discrete European money cosseted him under his mohair frock. Despite that, the geologist's Mohs value remained high. He welcomed Charles with a slight bow and a firm grip. Charles remembered his accent vividly from four years earlier at the Ayer Mansion on the other side of Boston. Quiet. Calming. Its timber raised the slightest frisson at the top of his spine. This time Charles was more able to enjoy the unfamiliar inflection.

"It's a pleasure to see you again. It has been quite a time since. The trip was good. Many thanks to your Mister Allen for the arrangements.

Holger demured. He caught a waiter's attention for Charles. Coffee arrived almost before Charles finished ordering. The room was quiet with just a few tables occupied. The sun passed through lace and palms.

"Tell me everything. Start where we left off.

Charles paused. He saw sunbeams glint dully on Wedgwood. Warm colors in the carpet complemented cherry wood panels. Dusky tin-glazed lamps. Holger's incongruous copper chopsticks reflected his wiry copper beard. Charles felt the still noticeable press of his prosthetic toes. His phantom finger tapped the linen. The air was vaguely fragrant. It was unreal. To ground himself, he talked.

The long train west. The frantic last-minute preparations in the Pacific Northwest. Foul weather on the leg up to the Bering. Awkward first-meetings, expedition politics, and maneuvering – avoided only by intense dedication to engineering and logistics. The conflict over Stefansson's sledge party. The second ice-in. Desperate struggles to brace the |Karluk|, stretch stores, keep spirits up. Captain Bartlett's defiant gramophone playing marches, even as the freezing water crept over his knees.

He told of more crew defections, parties lost through the ice, forays, and retreats. The hundred-mile march across the frozen deep. Hacking through pressure ridges as high as the club they sat in. Fearing death daily. Eventually feeling the ice change to frozen sand under their feet. Building camps under the Northern Lights. Standing watch for the white bear.

He talked of starvation rations. Of fistfights in the days after Bartlett left on his courageous journey. Of pitch-black noons. Mysterious sickness. Spoilt food. Of lingering death, one by one. Even cold-blooded murder for seabird eggs. He talked through the fine meal of people who fought over rotted seal's flippers. He had been one of them. He talked into the late afternoon. Eventually, he landed back at Nome and stopped talking.

Holger took a deep breath.

"You are a miracle of courage. I can only imagine what you survived. There must be so much more than I can know. And this is but the first half. You still must tell me of my countryman. The good Reverend Tollef Brevig. We must talk of the future. His, yours, mine.

Charles moved to speak. Holger put a hand up.

"But not now. Now you must get to your hotel and rest. I insist. Your rooms are at the Parker House nearby. The dining room is excellent. We will dine late and enjoy more of your outrageously enthralling tale.

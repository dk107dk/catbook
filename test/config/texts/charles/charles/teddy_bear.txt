"October 3rd, 1922 - Nome, Alaska

"Vilhjalmur Stefansson, organizer of the Wrangel Island Expedition and Development Corp. and leader of efforts to annex the Island into the British Empire, announced yesterday that the schooner Teddy Bear was caught in the ice northwest of the Island. Teddy Bear, captained by Joseph Bernard, was seen drifting rapidly miles offshore by hunters, who reported the fact to a wireless station. Three British men are aboard, along with a native party.

"Stefansson's remarks indicate he remains unconcerned by the fate of the four-man shore party occupying the Island since more than a year ago. Two of the men are experienced hands, "safer and more healthy in the friendly arctic than they would be on the streets of Calgary", said Stefansson. The men on the Island were landed with supplies and expected to hunt to support their habitation. "Their mission takes paramount importance and their safe relief is assured next season", said Stefansson.

"Teddy Bear, an ice-strengthened light gas-screw sailing vessel of few tons. She is not built to be iced-in, nor is she equipped for long-duration voyage, according to Nome's port office. Her master, Bernard, an experienced arctic operator had expected to return to Nome in late August or early September. In the first week of October she will have been away a month longer than planned. The Ship's exact location is impossible to determine.

"Stefansson said the Ship having been closed in was unusual for this time of year in that area. Nevertheless, the season has been difficult for a number of vessels, with three currently known to be adrift and five so far lost to the ice. The thirty-two ton fifty-five foot wooden gas screw power schooner Silver Wave, which had landed the trapped party on Wrangel Island more than a year ago, became frozen in the ice this month and was abandoned in Kotzebue Sound.

"Weather Service warnings call for conditions to worsen rapidly as Winter approaches. Shipping has withdrawn to southern routes with the end of the season. Ships now adrift will have only themselves and fortune to rely on.

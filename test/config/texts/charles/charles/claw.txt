Rockport's humid sea air was heavy with salt and seaweed. It plucked at Charles's nerves. It opened channels and rewove connections. On an unfamiliar shore Charles remolded himself autonomically. A body grown subtly supple morphed under unexpected pressure into something wholly unsuitable to his immediate needs.

Wrangel Island had scarred Charles's mind deeply. Even many decades later it haunted him. Essentially any day held the potential for some detail to trigger a bad spell, even in the heat of a beautiful summer's day in Rockport, a popular vacation town. A comfortable island scene nearly as unlike the Arctic as can be.

Charles and my grandmother, Saharalee Tanine, known as See See, strolled around downtown Rockport's Dock Square in the heat. Weaving through crowds of tourists. The other family members were chasing down other interests elsewhere. Touring the town's old quarries. Scoping out libraries. Crashing open houses. Who knows what? See See was worried for Charles's ancient back. Their drinks had long since warmed and been discarded. They were running out of steam. They needed to get out of the heat.

It was so bright. Charles had forgotten his sunglasses. Buying a pair just for the day was out of the question. The Cumbrian was tighter than a North Shore Yankee. Quartz in the paving stones sparkled. The sun was at two o’clock. Charles trudged uphill in its face. The glossy white clapboards. Glinting windows and chrome. Momentary sunbeams off the water behind the buildings. The inferior mirage shimmering above the engine blocks. Gull cries plaintive in the heat. Hot people pushing up against him. Summer in Rockport, Massachusetts in the eighties was the exhaustion of a packed beach town with too few trees.

Rockport is an artists' enclave. Galleries are jammed together, back to front. There were fifteen thousand vacationers in town that day. If they had all left with a canvas it would hardly have made a dent. See See and Charles shuffled blearily up the granite front stairs of one of the many galleries to get out of the sun.

The cold aluminum door frame. The arctic blast from overhead air conditioners amplified by area fans. Dry wind. Studio lights and white walls, white stairs, white in mirrors, and his suddenly cold sweat. When they stopped pushing and guiding him, he looked up into the wind and the whiteout abyss in front of him. Cold hunger bit him like the exploratory nape bite of a starving ship's cat.

Charles stopped outwardly responding. He had come unmoored.

The shop was full of artfully scratched antique frames, glazed palettes, mirror mosaics, rusted iron hand tools, glass beads on woven bracelets, and lots of nautical knickknacks. Long ago that had been the stuff of art in the minds of the artless. It had long become just an ironic part of the show. What sold paid the rent between infrequent sales of pricey canvases.

In front of Charles was the |pièce de résistance|. A five-foot-wide by seven-foot-tall unframed |masterstik|. Hand-stretched with frayed raw canvas edges peeking from the back. A modern mason's helping of oil paint knifed onto a frame that, by its topography, seemingly had had an equally fervent expression before. Five halogen mini floods hung from silver wires above a plate-glass screen. They confronted the AC and the fans with all but audible heat exchange.

The artist, Louis Burnett Fisk, perched on a paint-splattered stool. The stool stood on a raw-pine mezzanine landing. The landing looked like it had lost an argument with the artist's finishing spray gun. Stairs from the landing up to the loft behind angled sharply up imitating a ship's ladder. Fat synthetic ropes for handrails. One hand roughed out a charcoal sketch, one hand for the ship. As he drew, he studied Charles. And as he did, Charles dropped headfirst into the Artist’s vision in white.

Given its position, no surprise, the canvas was Lou's favorite. Not for depiction. That was mostly just layers of titanium and zinc. Rather, because of its overbearing weight and swirling alfredo of subtle textures. Heavy winter ice. The sun through a scrim of morning fog. Salt on bleached seagrass. The frosted thickness of a hundred years of New England white lead stabilizing rotted shingles. Somethings his sincerely superficial holidaymakers never really got.

But this guy sure got it. It seemed he might be getting it a bit too much.

"
The biting north wind pushed Charles almost into a crouch between waste-high drifts. Light changing. Heavy weather coming up fast, full of sleet and snow. The sun was withdrawing. Hunger made him want to simply slump down against a windrow. The ripped seam in his jacket burned his wrist. Seal Rock blurred and vanished in the onslaught.

It was too much. Hunting time was over. Nevertheless, the fear of being hunted stayed close. The white bear could be anywhere. Charles saw his footprints filling. Disappearing. Retreat was prudent.

He stepped awkwardly around on improvised snowshoes. The camp was at least a mile or so away. The unpredictable late winter weather could quickly turn again. Or it could continue to blow for days. He swung the rifle higher up across his pack. Started off with a weary swing crunch swing. The rocks made the swings high and aching. Progress athwart the wind was slow.

About three hundred yards on with his eyes crusting over, Charles's right foot slid down a sharply angled rock under the snow. The snowshoe snapped. His legs split painfully. The rifle caught behind him. He pitched back and at an angle as his ankle choked down between two boulders. The kinematics were not favorable. His fibula bending, cracking. He landed a glancing blow on his shoulder that probably saved his life by minimizing the head strike. It was minutes till he opened his eyes and could focus clearly.

Not a good circumstance for a storm growing more serious minute to minute.

Raising himself to his feet failed. He was dizzy. Nauseous. With no hope of being heard he hollered in hoarse bursts. Rolled out of his pack. Pulled the rifle to him and began to entomb himself in rocks, ice, and snow. His right foot was insensible. Left leg, cramped and tender. His hip was full of nails. All was riding on native-learned building and burrowing. He worked without hope, hopeful in effect.

Less than an hour later, Charles lay back and closed himself in. Sweat, ice, salt, and hunger in the dark. The rifle stood rising from a rock cairn. It flew a ragged bandanna on a stick from the snowshoe jammed in the bore. His back ached from the rocks and exertion. Fingers tingled and screamed. He ate the last biscuit crumbs mashed in pemmican and seal fat using his palms. There was no more saving for later.

Gradually the wind grew less distinct. He slept.

He woke shivering convulsively in the dark. Sharp pain in his lower back. Pain behind his eyes and forehead. How long? Was he out? Could he last? Till the storm abated? Till he went mad? Till his toes and feet were too far gone?

He woke again in silence and dark. Heart beating. Gnawing emptiness. Could the bears find him? Could anyone?

He woke a third time in wrenching pain as hands pulled his arms up through the snow. The light! The pain. All of the pain at once in sheets of gravel and lightning. The unspeakable whiteness that blinds. The white that never relents, never forgives, and never fails to overwhelm the eyes.

"
The hand reaching from a New England summer to Charles's shoulder was a cold claw. A three-fingered stainless-steel black rubber-tipped spring-loaded gripper. It touched him like ice. The Artist stood behind it, looking at him curiously. The prosthetic hand captured all of Charles's reviving attention. As a painter, not to say, a human, Lou was used to it.

"Hey man, come back. You're Ok. Take a seat. Take some water.

Charles could barely understand the salt-cured sunburned North Shore patois. He had no trouble understanding a face grooved by long lining, hooked with small scars, softened by graying stubble.

"You had a spell. But you're good now. Rest easy.

He was on a futon in a room behind the gallery. Canvas. Linseed oil. One-hundred-fifty-watt aluminum work lights on steel clips pointed up sheetrock loft walls with trails of glinting nail heads. Candle smoke streaks. Patchouli and sandalwood overcompensating for fried scallops. The artist's foot dragged lifelessly as he maneuvered a Twin Lights soda into Charles's hand. Charles jerked back from the cold. After a beat, took the bottle and gingerly sipped it. Driftwood hung on the walls. A black and white of the Artist. In it he had two hands, a fifty-inch gaff hook, and two sound legs.

Charles closed his eyes and saw the face of his lost wife, Aalunae. Dancing sundogs. And a steel claw hand. Cold fingers cased in limestone. And blackened, dead toes. A cod-whipped face gouged by flying long lines. His eyes teared up as he reached fearfully for his rifle. The bottle hit the floor. Lemon-lime foam chugged between the pine boards. Charles fell back against the pillows. He lost track of time, again.

See See dropped the phone on its hook. She came and kneeled by Charles. Took his hand. Whispered.

"Paul will be here soon.

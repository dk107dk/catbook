>1987 - Charles tells a story in Rockport, Massachusetts

The five converted chicken coops were humming with activity. At night half-barrel coal fire pits sent sparks into the sky. They flew over the fireflies hustling in the tall grasses of the long fallow field between South Street and Wallace Road. They flew under the stars. There was music and a little dancing. Cap guns, whippersnappers, and eating. Crickets and peepers, nightjars and bard owls.

In the morning, more talking, kids laughing, and bright chamber music bubbling out single-pane windows. The dirt turn-about in front of the coops was dusty. The ragged short grass was blond. There were cars parked under the trees on the right of the field. Most had scuffs and small rust spots. Someone smoked a pipe. The sky was warm.

At least every other year the younger Tanine, Schiller, and Maths generations collected in July. They had tried Providenciales, Holmes Chapel, and Kendal. Rockport was the one that stuck. It was roughly equidistant in travel time between Grand Turk and the UK. Less obviously, Aalana, Voight and Aalyrica Schiller's willingness to cheerfully hunker down in the only haphazardly habitable chicken coops on the edge of the last great rutted field of a failed farm surrounded by the beautiful, piquant art colony clinging to the stormy coast was at least endearing, if not fascinating, weird and a little adventurous. Who could say no to that?

The door to the slightly larger of the party-walled white shingle buildings stood propped open with a cinder block. From outside you could tell that the door opened from a kitchen. A skylight was also propped open. Moving to the door you would see that there was a shallow back room with a bead curtain. The kitchen seemed to take up most of the small frame. Doors to the left and right suggested that this house acted as the kitchen serving the other tiny houses.

Stepping inside you would have seen seven adults. They were cooking. Drinking. Setting up dominoes in curving chains and clever crosses. Pencils and Polaroids were scattered on the table. A three-year-old calendar was nailed to a stud. One straight-backed kitchen chair was tipped against the wall. The occupant was dropping and pulling a yo-yo. The yo-yo lit up as it traveled. Saharalee Tanine, usually called See See, was inducing the toy to spin at the end before flipping it up. For an amateur, she was pretty good.

This was the brain trust. Converted chicken coop notwithstanding.

At a table by the window by the door, you would have walked in sat a man. A first glance, a man closing on middle-aged. How old? Who can say for sure? Maybe it was just his disheveled mid-century getup? In any case. He was sketching in a way that looked likely to result in a snapped lead. His head wore a green accountant's eye shade. It was askew. A child might have placed it on him and then run away. Charles Chesterian's hands, all nine fingers, were steady. He paused sketching to drop a domino on top of two other dominoes in the chain Jampheto Maths was creating. Charles wasn't usually among the summer guests. He seemed perfectly at ease.

A man leaning against the rattling refrigerator pretended to help. In fact, Paul Tanine was just in the way. He was wearing a homemade tie-dye with a thread trailing a split shoulder seam. A woman was whirling between chopping block and sink and cupboard near Paul. She wielded a knife. He was repeatedly dodging it as he kept one eye on Charles. Aalana Tanine was looking one way and moving the other. She hummed as she worked. It made her seem absentminded. She was not. Aalana had kept her name.

On the other side of her, Anakoni Maths worked the stove. She rap tap tapped on anything at hand, more or less in time with Aalana's humming. Occasionally she sang a few words quietly. Occasionally she swore and rushed a hand to the sink for cold water. The grease spat. Bacon, eggs, hash browns appeared.

Voight Schiller squatted in front of the stove shifting his weight foot to foot as bread baked behind a crusty window. He was clearly offsides, though Koni didn't take offense. The cooking stretched and popped as the ingredients and bodies moved. See See made her yo-yo fly horizontally into the mix and back. A piston on a warped cam driving the machine herky-jerky. It all held together. But how?

Jamphe's dominoes suddenly started a multi-pronged rattle clacking dance. They slumped and scattered across the table and onto the plywood floor. Smiling, Koni kicked one under the stove playfully. He sat back grinning at her like he had accomplished something. That game was done. What to do next? He kicked his flip-flops under the table.

Without a signal, the kitchen was stormed by kids and animals. Plates levitated and circled. Baskets, salt, knives, and forks. Coffee spilled generously. The table was picketed and pushed out. Jampheto set up a card table against the kitchen table and Koni threw a flowered sheet over it. The kids were suddenly gone. Adults closed ranks on plates of food. There was focus and banter. Charles didn't eat much. Everyone else did their best to keep up.

"
When conversation and forks settled a bit everyone pushed back a little and looked at Paul. Paul looked at Charles. Charles looked at his sketch pad. Arkrel Tanine, called Ari, hidden behind a chair and the bead curtain looked at them all. It got quiet. Ari felt sure this would be interesting. He had an usually keen sense for that. Ari, as the eldest, was always underfoot. The next generation was every bit as curious as their parents were.

Paul cued his grandfather.

"Go ahead, Bora.

The older man looked up at Paul.

"Ok. Let me tell you all why this summer I came. It isn't just that it's lonely in Kendal without grandma Luna, bless her. Though it certainly is.

He paused. His eyes refocused. He would explain how little time he had actually been spending in Kendal later. Murder, the unravelling of mysteries biological and of physics, and to preclude suspicions as to his person. Kendal was for sure not the place for him.

"I want to tell you all a story.

Charles looked around at the faces in turn.

"Paul knows this story already from many years ago. It seems someone outside this room learned at least some of it. That has caused trouble. That trouble is becoming ever more of a problem. I'm worried and I need your help. Candidly, I'm a bit afraid.

Charles wasn't one to be afraid. He didn't look scared. However, no one ever took what Charles said at anything other than face value. He took sip of coffee. Tea was for home. Coffee for ships and foreign lands.

"Around 1931, 1932 I made a find. Like nothing youâ€™d ever expect to. I was out fell-walking. A little wall mending, a little path pulling. I did this a few times a week. On this day I went well further than usual. I was preoccupied by something. I forget what more. Up in the dells, the path I was on became rough. It wasn't much of a path, really. It was passable, but with a lot of breaks and stone fall. Higher than the grazing grounds or even scrub trees.

Charles wasn't looking directly at anyone. Jampheto looked at Charles. He was trying to picture the rocky, high landscape. Even having been to Kendal once, it wasn't coming easy.

"I went around an outcrop and was pulled up short. The side of the knott had given way.

Charles stopped to cough. It sounded like there was fluid down there. Jampheto topped up Charles's coffee. Charles drank another sip and continued.

"The footpath was steep there. So the stones and fill had flowed over and run further. The path itself had widened. It was also covered in debris for about twenty feet or so. I could see it ran around and up for another stone's throw, and straight into a wall of rock. That blockage must have fallen long before what came down closer to me. I should have just turned back. I suppose I wanted to see if there was a view from up there. Over the fells. I thought maybe all the way to the Windermere Water. So I started clambering over the slag.

He sounded like his breathing was becoming labored as if from the climb in his story. While he talked, Koni stood and walked to her bag hanging on a disused electric heater half tucked behind the fridge. She pulled out a bottle. Fished out two pills, and dropped the bottle back. She walked over behind Charles and carefully placed the pills by his spoon. Retaking her seat her hand brushed Aalana's shoulder.

Charles continued.

"About halfway up the remainder of the path, I thought I saw something. It looked too regular to be an outcrop. And too dark to be limestone. Maybe my eyes were stronger back then.

He looked down, hiding half a smile.

"At first, I thought it was a pipe or some other utility. It wasn't until I got closer that. Well, most people don't lay narrow pipes through limestone. What village roadway man would even consider it? Would it even be possible? I didn't think any of that clearly in the moment. At about then the sun was hot. My shirt was a mite damp with the hardscrabble.

"The dingus ended up being about level with my noggin. As I'm working my way closer it seemed more like an arm than a pipe. Who wants to be thinking about bog bodies in cliffs? But again, I realized this was solid limestone we're considering. And anyway it wasn't an arm. I was getting more and more curious. At this point, I wasn't thinking about the heat or being hungry or anything. Something didn't make sense.

Charles's speech wasn't overly slow. It was a bit tired. Still, he picked up energy from the story. His accent became a little harder to make out. Voight leaned in. Jampheto zeroed in on Charles's lips. Ari leaned forward, closer to the beads. The chair he was hiding behind tipped its balance just a bit towards the kitchen.

Daniel Tanine, who everyone called Dee Dee, clattered into the kitchen from the field and pulled up suddenly. Looked around at the silent adults. Looked like he was about to speak. Shut his mouth and dashed to the fridge, pulled out a Pepsi, and beat a hasty retreat. Paul settled back against the fridge. See See pulled up the yo-yo silently and pocketed it.

Charles continued. In a quiet but urgent voice.

"Well, now don't you know, it was an artifact. It had edges. A part of a machine, I thought. Sticking out of solid rock. I could imagine it was the far end of some kind of armed, articulated device. Frozen solid in solid rock. Yellow limestone, a little sandstone, slate here and there. Decidedly not soft earth, not soil. This was rock, as hard as you like. An escarpment. A face broken from what was once a mountain in a range as proud as the alps.

He paused. Looked up, cocking his head. Alert eyes squinted. Pierced through the dark beads. Straight into Ari's eyes. Ari tensed up. He didn't breathe. Then, as quickly, Charles looked away.

Charles coughed. Made a reach for water. He leaned back.

"It's elevenses. I'm jammed up and jumpy, and I haven't yet seen the sun. Let's take our constitutional. Then we can talk more. What say you?

They all leaned back. Stood up. Movements jerky, speeding up like a spell broken. Aalana went to Charles. Voight grabbed Charlesâ€™s gnarled walking stick, encrusted with expedition medals, curious runes, and a copper viper. They moved as a pack. Aalana steadied Charles so he wouldn't fall on the sill. It was unnecessary.

The party tumbled out the door into the dry field baking in the sun. The paused for their eyes to adjust. It was exactly the color of Kendal limestone. Everyone was thinking it.

In autumn 1913 the |Karluk| stuck fast. The leads she had followed had collapsed. Pack ice had collided and hardened. Locked in, she had drifted briskly northwest throughout the fall. Now winter was nigh. Captain Bartlett projected sangfroid with an intentionality that didn't go unnoticed. There were no complaints. Outwardly the balance was to optimism.

A thick cable-laid hawser hung down to the ice past the base of the bowsprit inside the backstay. The line was frozen to the top of a moraine of ice blocks from the fore rigging, deck, and scuppers. That fall was slopped on top of the pressure ridge memorializing where the last lead had closed. Charles Chesterian hung halfway up the ice. One of the ship's auxiliary boats swayed from the jibboom over his head. He looked into the last moments of a low sun as if washing salt out of his mouth.

Above on the foredeck, ten strong voices sang Amazing Grace in steady four-part harmony that belied the choir's inexperience.

"Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come.

The sun, a drop of blood on pale skin. It could not hold. Dimmed by a mist of blown ice crystals, it abruptly dropped into a deep polynya. Stars flushed across Charles's vision. Sunspots shrank and darkened to sapphire. The arctic stars were even more beautiful than the sun. The song ended. Four-part harmony collapsed into indistinct voices and stamping feet. The wind returned. A dog barked. The ice groaned and bent.

This was the first night of more than a month of night. Charlie was ready. From his first days at Keyham College in His Majesty's service, this was the life he yearned for: black night on the ice. Trapped. Bitter cold. All at stake.

It was a questionable ship with an inexperienced crew. Many of whom knew even less of ice and sea than Charles did. His responsibilities were, consequently, many. Some granted, some assumed. Familiar ropes and sails beside unfamiliar technologies. Cold rolled steel plates. Single-screw gas engines. Thirty-five-millimeter film. Irish felt, pemmican, and seal fur boots. Dogs for work, and very possibly for food. Every part of an arctic adventure was welcome.

Charles saw in his Captain a mentor and role model. The Captain had included Charles in every tactical and most strategic deliberations since expedition leader Vilhjalmur Stefansson's exit. Charles absorbed everything he heard. Their minds were alike on most things, including holding the absent Stefansson in contempt.

The older man had many reservations about the voyage. Deep inside, disdain for his own acquiescence in accepting the |Karluk| as sufficient ship for the ice. She clearly was not. Bartlett knew he could have protested more vigorously its complement of inexperienced men. Likewise, Stefansson's decision two months prior to leave with a party of the strongest on a landward provisioning mission Bartlett saw as unnecessary, a risk to all, and very likely cowardice.

Faced with the same facts, Charles simply suppressed his disgust. He vowed to never take the easy path, nor seek fame at the expense of right. Both men preferred sweat, windburn, and sore muscles to rumination and diary writing. The young man was determined to grow into the form of the old.

As the light faded the wind stepped up. On cue with the first strong gust, Charles turned on his right leg, away from the ship, to climb down the ridge. The wind caught him unbalanced. Involuntarily, he reached to grab his hood, as if it might blow away. His clumsy swaddled foot missed its target by an inch.

The ice ridge crumbled under his weight. Without warning, it crashed down in a subscale avalanche of snow, ice crystals, wood, hemp and paint dust. Fragments of fish scales, hairs, piss, and spittle. Snapping hexagons roared furiously in the microcosm as they cascaded down towards the hard pack ice.

Charles's left knee buckled as his left hand jerked out of a mitten that had become sweat-frozen to the rope. His back arched as his neck and shoulders pulled outwards. Left leg winched around his hip in free-fall. His head hit the downslope at ten miles per hour. He came to rest in a heap, legs dangerously akimbo. His ears rang. Snow in his nose and his collar. Both mittens gone.

It took Charles a minute to catch his breath and move. There was a salty, coppery taste. Even after he got his head above his legs, it took him another minute to recover some poise. He found his right mitten. The left one was still stuck to the rope. He retrieved it. Then backed slowly down onto the flat ice.

Charles put his hood back up. Shook the snow off. He walked slowly alongside the ship, back to the gangway ladder. Climbed carefully, going easy on his right wrist. Permission to come aboard? The watch granted it with a desultorily wave.

Charles was shivering hard. He had no chit-chat. The wind was rising. He passed quickly down the second deck to the galley for coffee and the stove. It would be a long winter, come what may. In a moment of awareness, he realized it would turn out to be much longer than he had expected.

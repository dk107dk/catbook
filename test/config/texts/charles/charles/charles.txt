>1935 - A burial north of Kendal, Lake District, England

"I will simply stop being an explorer.

The man clenching his jaw had lived his best years in the wild. Also his worst. He labored in the high fells between the Kentmere and Longsleddale valleys. Far from the most remote place. About six miles upland from the northern reaches of Lake Windermere. Ten or eleven miles from the village of Kirkby Kendal, where his family lived. So not so far, but definitely craggy, thorny, and satisfyingly wild.

This was his land, now. Rocks, pastures, a stream, a few stunted trees. A windy land carved through with dry-stack walls that climbed upfell to ridges. Land that had not so recently been thrust up from the sea in a jagged line, now worn.

He slid his forefinger along a limestone seam and lifted his hammer. His joints rubbed and cricked. There was a tightness in his hands. He was of an indifferent age; maybe old or not. Either way, the land was quiet. It was waiting for the clatter-whack of the hammer against rock that was much older and more stiff than he.

Much later in a long life he might have asked an Internet search engine for tips on meditation. But at that time, he could not. Instead, he independently invented mindfulness for himself. The invention was born of twin fears. Of losing himself in a past best forgotten. And the equally terrible chance of rocks falling and breaking his legs. The fells weren't endless. But given his secluded location, it would surely be quite some time till anyone would find him. What they found might well be his remains, though that was a bit more drama than he expected. He had learned to live with being a trifle morbid.

Some say mindfulness is care and focusing on the little things in the present. A brackish water one hundred yards below him hosted an alien female snapper. An armor-plated invasive species. How she got there who could say? The world is full of present yet unexplainable little things.

One of her tiny hatchlings was eyeing a dead fish's fin swaying in the murk over its hiding place in the mud. The corpse was, relatively speaking, the size of a finback whale. A turtle so tiny would have no business with such a monster. Nevertheless, hunger will make one bold, and so the critter wriggled its minute claws. Whether it ate flesh that evening or continued to make do with algae and mud mites is but a little thing.

Overhead, back a bit from the water, a bird that might live twenty thousand days fewer than the turtle, assuming luck in its formative years, slammed the thin ridge of its head against the trunk of a stunted tree. It applied a force per square inch far greater than the man's hammer, again relatively speaking. Its heart beat an order of magnitude faster than the heart of the man. The man stood so far from the foreshortened world of the hammering bird that he might as well have not existed. He was but a little thing.

Charles Chesterian filled the rusted bucket of an over-built wheelbarrow with rocks he broke from the exposed edge or pried from the ground. Quartz glinted in the bright diffuse fells light. The cart filled. The man gripped the bleached handles. He lifted with his whole upper body, adjusting his subconscious lateral perception of balance against the three-point ground contact at a rate at least an order of magnitude faster than the distant hammering of the bird. He pushed.

The wheelbarrow lurched forward and picked up steam pulling him downhill. Charles calculated how to restrain it with his major muscle groups enough to retard the barrow to a safe controllable pace, without causing a pulled muscle, hernia, or twisted ankle. In very little time, the struggle against gravity, momentum, and speed became urgent. He approached the end of the grass path. The end was a small cliff that, again, might have been his end. It, therefore, commanded his concentration on the here and now.

Momentarily, he put his weight well back, stopping the wheel just short of the drop. He paused and breathed out molecules by the sextillions. His muscle cells began to rebuild by the billions. And then he leaned forward again, carefully, slowly. And he tipped the rocks he had broken from their strong molecular bonds at significant cost freely over the edge. They fell for about a thousand milliseconds. There was sound.

Why did the man go to all the trouble? The turtle probably ate. The bird probably ate or created shelter. The man did neither. He worked hard and threw away the fruits. Over a small cliff. To a growing pile of slag at the bottom. To cover what? And then he turned and hauled the heavy wheelbarrow back up to his works. He lifted his hammer again. For hours he continued thus. The heap didn't conceal enough, to his eye.

This tedious work, while perhaps seeming meaningless from afar, was at the cusp of a vast reordering. Little things. Unknown reasons. Quiet movements. Under these, the totality of our universe ponderously adapts. Grand things start slowly. Outcomes emerge only quite some time later. Charles couldn't know how his labor would motivate his descendants to act. History is the story of how things begin.

Meanwhile, he was a simple man. Hungry. Tired. He hadn't yet figured it all out. Evening was coming. And yet the little slag hillock had several feet to grow before Charles let go the day.

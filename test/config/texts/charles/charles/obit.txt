>1989 - An obituary taped to Alasha's mirror

"The Westmorland Gazette

"Charles Edwin Chesterian, polar explorer, engineer, and business man, passed away in May at ninety seven. He died in a fall on Ben Nevis while solo traversing the Càrn Mòr Dearg route. It was a daring scramble for one so old. Confidants disclaimed knowledge of his plans, but said he had been working hard to increase his strength and stamina.

"Chesterian's arctic explorations began in 1912 when he joined the Karluk as Stores Officer. The Ship was one of seven attached to the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913. Prior to joining the Expedition, Charles graduated as Engineering Officer First Class at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham, the youngest officer candidate in the school's history.

"In 1914 Chesterian overwintered on Wrangel Island, one hundred miles north of Siberia, after escaping from the sinking of the Karluk. His party was rescued by Captain Robert Bartlett the following autumn. Following that, Charles trekked solo through Alaska working to increase the survey accuracy of several minor ranges. He was also a member of the 1922 attempted rescue of a second party on Wrangel Island.

"Following his arctic career, Chesterian lectured in geography, naval engineering, and arctic indigenous peoples at Victoria University, now Manchester University. With his wife Aalunae Chesterian, née Fellsman, he ran a successful Kendal Mint Cake business. Among their customers, many of Charles's former arctic and antarctic exploration collogues.

"Chesterian was awarded the Bergen Civic Service Medal by the City of Bergen, Norway for service to the City and Crown. He received an honorary doctorate from Victoria University. Charles was a member of the Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research Advisory Board, also based in Bergen.

"Charles Chesterian is survived by his daughter Aalasha Tanine, the Lady Dalzell, of Motherwell.

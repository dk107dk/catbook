>1942 - Charles sleeps rough above Longsleddale

The week after his signature on the Fellfall Farm deed dried Charles walked his line. He and Aalunae now owned a long, high contiguous plot running from the backside of Kentmere Pike to left bank of the Sprint. From Steel Rigg, through Ravens Craig, Goat Scar, and down the Longsleddale. Rough, cheap land, much of it, only fit for light grazing, hard scrambling, and young Aalasha playing botanical explorer.

They had stitched the acreage together from many odd lots over a decade, till finally anchoring it to the farm. Deeds were just paper. Markers were thin on the heights. Eyes were scarce. Still, having the paper allowed him to proceed to work the highlands in a way that might attract notice, despite the remote location.

Charles planned for something less than a quarry, yet well more than clearing a pasture. If there were more objects of a similar nature, he wanted to know it. If he found nothing more, at least let the new digs distract from the old. Over the years, he would occasionally suggest Aalasha grab gloves and boots and come help him improve the fields' drainage. Predictably, the bluff worked. It turned out that she always had other child's play committments or preferred to sow confusion in the company's kitchens far from his doings. That suited Charles just fine.

It took Charles two days and four trips to cart what he needed up the knott for that first effort. In his mind he had named and renamed the site of his find several times. Recently, Rodgers Knott, after the camp on Wrangel Island. That didn't stick. Ultimately, it was just the image of strange black metal. Since he no longer spoke of the Artifact, the site he found it didn't really need a proper name.

Aalunae looked only the slightest bit concerned. He could tell. No one else would have known from any outward sign. Aalunae had a strong preference for unannounced camping trips on the high fells in cold weather with heavy gear and no explanations. At least, compared to the ever-present threat of Charles renewing his interest in seasons-eating, body-maiming arctic misadventures. In light of his mission, she could spare him a few days. In the meantime, her tiny factory was all but overwhelmed. They were flat-out creating pallets of mint cakes for the African expeditionary forces.

She said nothing. He said nothing.

Charles borrowed a small wagon from Old Beck, a wainwright with a shop near the mint cake factory. Someone else might ask unneeded questions. Beck knew the business enough to not be curious about what might be traveled in his wagon to where. And he was too deaf to get into gossip.

Charles collected prospecting and hauling equipment from family and friendly tradesmen. Camping gear he had. Aalunae had a cousin in Kentmere with a farm backed up against the high fells. He drove out to the furthest field house and laid out his cartage. On the way back he stopped in for tea. They discussed camping and birds.

The main work of each haul up to the site was between the ragged edge of the commons and the highest parliamentary enclosures. The rough north of Kenmere and Sadgill. Up amid the small waters, gills, crags, and scree. Where rivulets of the Kent and the slide path of a boulder were often indistinguishable. Charles staged his tools and packs out of sight behind a fells gate about two miles up. There was still frost. No sheep minders. Time yet for hay, not grazing. Quiet, but for the wind.

Charles's wheelbarrow was made of iron hardware and heavy wood. The rubber tread was solid. The English make objects that survive wars. The effort to push its wheels from the farm and then pull it from the commons to the top consumed much bread, Cheshire, several onions, and a pair of snapped laces.

At the end of Tuesday, he pitched his tarp, drank dregs of cold-brewed tea, and ate the remains. Wednesday two more trips. In total, he had traveled at least twelve miles, moving more than two hundred and fifty pounds, nine hundred vertical feet. He dropped the last of his materiel in the place where he wanted it and sat down.

That night Charles stood on a ridge that bent the sky and folded it around him. The stars were always the same northern stars. They were a constant. Somehow, he felt, time had got it wrong. Something long ago forced together two things that were intended to be immiscible. Grains of an alloy incompletely sintered. The scale was wrong. The worn mountain he stood on was as to the Artifact as the Artifact was to the sand grains it was embedded in. What machine lives in rock like a fish inhabits water?  What metal thing carries mountains molded into its back? How the hell old was it?

All of a sudden, Charles became aware of piston engines high up. Formation-flying pneumatic die grinders chewing through the sky. He hustled to the fire and kicked it to embers. Dropped the tarp with a yank. Pulled it out to cover the barrow in a way he hoped looked more like a small outcrop. Looked around at his equipment and packs in piles. Quickly pulled the lighter covered materials under the tarp as much as possible. Everything else as flat as he could make it. No time for more. Dropped flat and pulled his dark wool blanket close around him. Breathing hard.

The engines were long past. Still he listened. Nothing. Wind. Were there tiny flaps? Pops of fabric? Bird calls? Had the smoke of the fire dispersed? Had the light been visible? Were there men in the air? Was the massif an occupation exercise, Special Air training, deep infil? How would he know when he could move? Cold seeped into his heavy boots.

He lay there so long morning came. Charles jerked awake. Face full of stony soil. Five bright .30 caliber bullets made in Springfield, Massachusetts arrayed in a taunting halo pointing at his head. A pale unsympathetic sun. Hungry, stiff, cold, and, in principle, dead. There was no sign of his attacker.

He started assembling a fire. Tea for the drawing-room, coffee for the field. His temples throbbed. He decided to skip the coffee and the fire. Just let his uncareful head bomb and get on with it. In another world, it might have been a Luftwaffe boot knife in his back.

Charles pulled the tarp out flat. Laid out his things in some kind of order. He found a rucksack and pulled out his battered Kershaws. Lay several minutes scanning degree by degree. No infantry was visible. He chewed down a bit of jerky. Washed his mouth from his canteen.

"Should have bivouacked below. Thoughtless bloody idiot.

Charles kicked at a rock with his wood-toe-filled boot. He started moving his supplies down to the dig site. Camping in the cul-de-sac behind the rockfall would be cramped. Much less exposed, though. At the same time, it could call attention. Then again, up there against the sky called attention too, and in a much wider field of view.

There was no answer. He couldn't vanish into the landscape. And it wasn't becoming less exposed for him wasting time worrying about an unfixable problem. Charles took a deep breath, got his head right, and got down to work. It was his land. There was time. Not enough, but some. He had food for a week. He would be back.

Aalunae didn't see Charles stumble down from the fell at dusk till a long, hungry fortnight later. He was bruised and torn. She had cuts and burns. Her workers had shipped more than eighty thousand mint cakes to North Africa via Liverpool to fight demons. Charles had been fighting demons no less tenacious. Both were exhausted.

She said nothing. He said nothing. Charles still knew nothing, but the new work had begun.

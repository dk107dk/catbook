>1914 - Charles returns to Nome, Alaska

The |Karluk| was crushed by the ice in January, 1914. The surviving shipmates struggled over the frozen sea to Wrangel Island, one hundred miles north of the Siberian coast. It had been a hard winter. It was followed by a brief and almost equally hard summer. Men died.

At what can be fairly described as the eleventh hour, with winter again leaning back to swing, the party was rescued. It had been a year since the ordeal began. The extraction concluded only Charles Chesterian's first run-in with Wrangel. The outcome, though on the face satisfactory, sadly did not assure it would be his last encounter with the dark island, nor even his most heartbreaking.

It was lost on none of the castaways that a rescue mission is a success only when it finally lands. Traveling near the permanent ice north of the Arctic Circle in autumn is unpredictable. Even the mere six hundred miles from Wrangel Island in the Chukchi Sea down to Nome on the Straits bears considerable uncertainty.

The rescuing ship, |King and Winge|, encountered the would-be rescuers, the |USS Bear|, led by Bartlett, though not captained by him. Captain Jochimsen of the |King| signaled and hove to. A group came across from |Bear| in a longboat. The sea was rough. A stiff wind from the north. Coming aboard, Bartlett immediately began giving orders. He leavened these with complements and brassy good cheer.

Bartlett was already a hero in many eyes, though not all. After leading most of the |Karluk| party to Wrangel Island, he had departed with one of the Inuit. They crossed the ice to Siberia. From there, dead-reckoned through hundreds of inhospitable hungry miles to the Pacific coast. Thence back to the States to mount a rescue mission. Had he not survived, the party stranded on the island would have died badly. As it was, it was a close thing.

So they were saved. Or at least nearly so. Then came the final indignity of a long trial, poorly ended. Bartlett ordered the Wrangell party across to the |Bear|. After discussion amongst themselves, they had no inclination to leave the |King| in an open boat with light fading on the edge of winter. To what advantage? The promise of a doctor? Let the doctor come across, they said. Let us forthwith to the doctors at Nome. Let us do anything but add further delay, further risk, and further discomfort. The move was to only Bartlett's satisfaction. He would deliver his party back to civilization as a hero.

The mood was dark. However, a transfer was effected relatively smoothly. The party's possessions were immaterial. Two trips did the job. Feelings lifted as the |Bear| caught the wind. Nevertheless, the unnecessary strain between the stranded and their rescuer was slow to dissipate. Seen in retrospect, having put them at risk in the |Karluk|, he saved their lives, only to risk them again, if trivially, to run a stopper knot on his reputation.

The |Bear| made an attempt to reach a possible second-stranded party at Herald Island with little success. Bartlett saw no further value in delay. The ship turned south. She finally arrived off Nome Beach in September. It was late in the season. They had been fortunate.

A ragged crowd gathered. Everyone wanted to see the group rescued from Wrangel Island. Nome was perennially short of entertainment. Mainly bar fights and house fires. The shoreman's momentary amusement was the seaman's moment to exhale. Nome Beach was a narrow, cold pebbly strip. Cat-iced rain barrels. A thin row of wood buildings, a few streets, and tents. The onlookers were cold. They coughed and they spat. The water was cold and rough. To Charles, it looked like paradise. No raucous digger's guff could spoil that.

The bad effects weighed heavily. It was ever thus to explorers – and many have fared far worse. Still, Charles was unquestionably banged up. Frostbitten hands. One little finger lost. Lingering after-effects of nephritis and early-stage scurvy. Thick scarring and nerve damage on one forearm. The loss of two toes. Hair thin and brittle. Eyes sore from repeated snow blindness. The weight he lost seemed in no hurry to return.

The ship came close to shore and the shore sent out a lighter. Men, and a few women, helped the rescued up the beach. Captain Bartlett shepherded the group to shelter. More than one coatless man wrapped in a wool blanket. The |Bear| had little spare clothes to replace what had been reduced to rags on Wrangel. The party entered the Board Of Trade saloon close by the landing on Front Street. Bartlett had disbursed them a little money. The keeper, Thagard, stood the refugees a simple second-class meal that looked to them like a feast and tasted like home. Then Bartlett divided the men up between shared rooms at the Board Of Trade, the Dexter, and the Discovery. Most slept for several days.

Soon, Captain Bartlett put those who desired to go on the schooner |Challenge| headed for the States. They left Nome just before the coming winter made the journey impossible. |Challenge| was a small ship running mail and stores up and down Alaska. After she left, Nome was locked in for the winter.

"
Charles was not aboard |Challenge| when she sailed. As one of two Royal Navy officers seconded to the Canadian Arctic Expedition, Charles was not keen to report in with so little to show. Especially while the Expedition’s Southern Party was still out discovering Canada's high arctic islands. They were somewhere to the northeast above the Provinces. Charles decided he would head north. With luck he would meet up with overwinterers at Wales, Wainwright, Point Barrow, or Herschel.

He set off with an Inuit hunter going by the English name Chain-Talk, heading towards Port Clarence. That was November. Charles was still underweight. Port Clarence, a barrier point tied island, lay about seventy miles north following the coast. There was no road. It was slow going. The rags stuffing the void in his boot quickly froze. Food was light. Chain-Talk hunted as they went. Charles improved his mood early on by taking a pair of foxes. Shelter was poor.

Clarence was barren. A point on the inner bay shore called Teller could be loosely called a Town. It was held by a small rabble of reindeer herders, missionaries, beach-placer brawlers, stranded prostitutes and seamen, along with a few native hunters. Chain-Talk had chaffed at the time Charles spent scouting the coast. In Teller they could simply ask for word of the Expedition. There was none.

The pair turned northwest. They crossed the gap on the ice and followed around the curve of the bay. Brevig Mission offered temporary warmth. Further north, Wales did not. A reindeer station on the trail east towards Shishmaref offered a little food. Still no news. Charles was increasingly grim. Chain-Talk increasingly cranky.

Eventually they completed their grand loop of the Seward Peninsula. They exited through the five shacks called Deering Village. Still with no word of the Expedition. Six days past the last hardscrabble habitations near Buckland, Charles and Chain-Talk finally fell out. That night, Chain-Talk left him a little food and continued north into the wild, unburdened by the white man who didn't know his limits.

When Charles woke that morning, he had a reckoning. With no word of the Expedition, not enough food or ammunition to trek alone, and being mentally and physically in desperate shape, he could not continue. He decided to dash west southwest through the rough upland valleys of the Peninsula in a bid to reach help in about ten days at Teller. That way avoiding the Kigluaik and Bendeleben ranges between him and Nome. He was as far from Teller as Liverpool is from London. The land, unmapped and incomparably rougher. It took him more than twenty.

In February Charles ended his expedition. Reverend Tollef Brevig, a grizzled Norwegian Lutheran, ran the Mission Orphanage across the spit from Teller. He followed the sound of his dogs out beyond the half-finished reindeer pens. Charlies was hobbling on a driftwood staff. He fell, mumbling semi-coherently. His clothes were frozen to his skin. He had come a hard circuitous five hundred miles.

It was a long, brutal winter. Charles finally reentered Nome in August, limping alone from the north past melting aufeis, broken vehicles, discarded portage, and burned buildings. Chastened. All in all, though, a bit less broken than when he had left, thanks to the Reverend. He was still a Royal Navy engineering officer and an explorer. As such, and in light of the continuing struggles of the various branches of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, Charles's report could be assumed to be anticipated by his superiors. He promptly found passage south.

"
Arriving in Seattle too poor to move slowly, Charles immediately transshipped. Made his way up the coast to the Royal Navy's former digs at Esquimalt. Bagless, penniless, shivering, emaciated, and limping. His salute to the Canadian Naval Service duty officer was impressive only in as much as he delivered it with pride. The DO settled his papers and had an orderly march him to chow and then bed. In the morning a corpsman put him on bed rest and double rations for as many weeks as it took. Canadian hospitality gave him time to write up his reports and personal observations.

By late September some things were settling into place. Vilhjalmur Stefansson was still not in evidence. In his place, Captain Bartlett sent word discharging Charles from the Expedition, with distinction. Mail that had been chasing Charles for years was beginning to catch up to him. Postmarks from London and Manchester were expected.

A letter arrived circuitously in September from Holger Beskyttersen. It was more of a surprise to Charles. Holger inquired after his health and requested that he stop in New England on his way back to England. This request fit perfectly with another that Reverend Breviq had made. The coincidental fit felt almost preordained.

Charles recovered as quickly as he could. As soon as he felt able to move, he made plans. The trip east to Boston was long and expensive. Charles still felt uncomfortable talking and navigating cities. Nevertheless, he sent word to Holger that he was coming.

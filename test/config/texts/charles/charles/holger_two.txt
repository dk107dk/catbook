Holger waited for Charles at a secluded table in the Parker House dining room. He had had the light dimmed. Hooded candles lit the fine cloth. Flames reflected off the heavy silver. A fire roared nearby. Its crackling merged with the faintest treble of cutlery on stoneware. The click of crystal against glass. Knife sliding across fork. Ice crunch deadened by fine linen. He signaled the sommelier as Charles approached, escorted by the maître d'.

The evening began with |aperitif| and small dishes. Quiet talk. The European war, briefly. The Symphony's outstanding season. The ambitions of Boston's many patrons of the arts. Charles was of course well out of his depth. When not in the wild, it was a constant. Holger was a gracious conversationalist who guided and encouraged, steering deftly around the gaps in young Charles's experience.

Over the main course, the conversation cycled to the sciences and industry. And thence, the Arctic exploration. Charles was on increasingly firmer footing. While a novice to the economic and political aspects, he was entering his element. Holger was appreciative. Together they enthusiastically explored the subject.

In the pause after the entrée, Holger gently navigated into Norwegian waters.

"Now, my friend, you perhaps have something for me?

Charles offered a letter with a momentary panic knowing how the crumpled envelope must look. Several times folded. Yellowed from saltwater, meat, and sweat. He would not have wanted to sniff it. The faded writing was smeared. It came from a graceful quill pen. Not the kind one might expect to find north of the sixty-fifth. The flap was still mostly glued down.

Holger tilted a candle shade. Held the three-by-seven-inch envelope to the light. Heavy, quality paper. Firm handwriting in an easy size.

|To Holger Beskyttersen
|Boston, Massachusetts or Bergen, Norway
|From Teller Mission, Alaska
|In confidence

The top fold bore the remains of a red wax seal. One such as a heavy seal ring might make. Indistinct and mysterious. Charles had inspected the seal before it degraded. The outline of a two-sailed single-masted ship. Around that, a circumscribing band with Latin and what Charles assumed was Norwegian. The ship had struck Charles as being twelfth or thirteenth century. He was no expert. The wax had left a shadow and the ring a deep impression.

After a time Holger lowered the envelope. He slit the top with a knife. It was a familiar gesture, though in the small. Inside, a letter and a thin chain.

Despite the warmth, Charles faded back to the north.

"
They were exposed, crouched deep in snow-blown scrub. Reverend Tollef Brevig slit his buck's throat with a casual flick. The motion was unconsidered and firm through the warm skin. Charles very slightly pulled back. Tollef must have caught the tiny motion peripherally. The hunter's talent for the minute. He shifted his weight back.

"It is the less cruel. It is the more painless. He is god's creature, too. Blessed, as we.

His voice was not strong. The forest made noises. He coughed raggedly. Charles thought:

"Or cursed. Just as much we. Though, we by our own hands. He by ours.

Tollef pulled bony fingers from ragged mittens. He wrapped a leather thong around the animal's front legs above the joint. Created a slip-loop with the braided end and pulled the cord tight. He fell on one hand. Charles winced. In his state an icing could be a disaster.

He helped Tollef lean into the relative warmth of the cooling animal. Charles took the knife and cut a shallow short gash below the base of its chest behind the foreleg. Plunged Tollef's hand deep below the skin. They waited there thirty seconds. The blood cooled. The dark deepened. The hand warmed perhaps just enough. The rest of them cooled dangerously. Crystals formed.

It was time to go. And quickly. They were miles from shelter. Charles pulled and helped Tollef stay upright. They made slow progress. It became harder and harder to see. The light. The wind. Sharp, dry |snøføykje| whipped off the hoar. Stinging. Charles could feel his shoulders stretching. Could feel his hips grinding. His hands and feet, not at all. Slower and slower. Tollef, heavier, unsteady. They struggled on. There was no choice.

When the reindeer station came into view it was just in time to keep Charles from dropping the deer. The door to the nearest shelter was difficult. They fell into a cold, still, bare room. Charles propped his rifle by the door. A bear would likely follow the blood. If that happened and it wasn't a quick death, it was more meat.

Charles jumped in place as well as he could for a few minutes. His deadened hands under his arms burning. There was a little wood. Eventually he got a fire started. They propped each other up as close as they could. In time, scraps of food. Later, Charles cut the heart out of the deer. They ate more. Fingers and toes burned as warmth returned. Another long day ended. They lived.

"
Holger read the short letter twice. He lifted the chain. It held a snapped bronze medallion. Holger curled it tightly in his fist. His expression, fixed, unreadable. And by that, transparently expressive.

"I'm sorry for your loss. He was a good man. He saved my life and my sanity. Gave me hope. I wish I could have done more.

Charles spoke quietly to keep his voice from shaking. He felt all at once cold, despite the fire. And achingly tired. The Reverend was but one of many deaths. And yet his lost hurt more.

Holger still stared at the letter. Through the letter at the flame. His hand dropped heavily to the table. They sat quietly.

"Tollef wrote that I must give you this.

Holger held out the chain to Charles. Charles took it. It was fine work. Old. Delicate but strong. A simple, durable clasp. The medallion was half of a seal. Similar to that that had sealed the envelope. Broken in half through the mast. Charles couldn't speak, and anyway didn’t want to.

Holger reached to his throat. Removed his silver collar pin. Loosened his tie. Unbuttoned the collar. Carefully pulled out a gold chain. Held up a brass half-moon. The match to the one Charles held. they put them together under in the light. It was a perfect join.

The silence was quite expressive. Some time passed before their server dared approach.

>1987 - A plan is put into effect in the World

The plan had at first seemed simple. As simple as it was necessary. Charles would vanish. Become a nullity. A footnote with a modest obituary. Allow the heat to die down. Give Paul time to gather resources. To figure out what to do. To make a grander plan.

Easier said than done.

The broad strokes were straightforward. Gunnarr Beskyttersens's family owned large tracts of Svalbard. It was a wilderness. For most people, well beyond the dragons lurking at the top of the map. Thus, for Charles Chesterian, familiar turf. He had made a couple of quick trips there for Holger Beskyttersens in years past. The destination part of the plan was, in fact, the easy part.

The long-term logistics were harder. For a man such as Charles, living years unsupported in the Arctic is possible. Though, a younger man would have had a easier time of it. Nevertheless, so far so good.

However, there were some caveats. Setting aside polar bears, a man who didn't have to look over his shoulder would have an easier time still. A man with no need to communicate with the outside world, even better. A man who had no cause to prepare for a quick exit, likewise, simpler still. These security complications needed more careful attention. Familiar territory or not, it was going to be a very new type of adventure for Charles.

It was unsaid, though assumed, that the Artifact would be with Charles's person. That raised the stakes. Security and going solo was something of a conundrum. Stealth and hardpoints were seen as crucial. If not impossible, it must be at least very difficult to see Charles's tracks. If found, Charles needed to know that, regardless of whatever for him, the Artifact would nevertheless be safe.

Charles was soon to go climbing on Ben Nevis. Imprudently for one his age, alone. He would fall. Some days later his body would be found. In terrible shape, mangled at the base of a cliff. It would be a simple closed casket ceremony and cremation. His ashes would be scattered on the mountain. So much for a local hero, explorer to the end.

In doing it, Paul would learn a bit about cloak and dagger. Or at least about petty corruption. Gussying up a non-event into a tragic moment was new. Nevertheless, all seemed doable. And Paul suspected the learnings might be useful again later.

The great Scottish peak would become a symbol on which to hang a convincing, though ultimately forgettable, obituary. Within the secret world of CHRONOS, Ben Nevis became a bit of wink and nudge misdirection. And CHRONOS? That was a straight-up joke that stuck. The Cabal of Horological Nonconformists. Of course they needed a name for their conspiracy. Everyone assumed Koni started it. Who else? Anyway it kind of works, right?

Ben Nevis was not just any mountain. It was, in fact, two mountains. One, the highest peak of Scotland. And the other, one of the higher peaks in the far north of Spitsbergen Island in Svalbard. The Norwegian mountain was named after the Scottish Ben Nevis by William Speirs Bruce. He surveyed it as part of the second of Albert I's Monaco Expeditions in 1899. Bruce, an irascible codger unused to close friendships, had been, as it happened, a friendly acquaintance of Charles's. Of course he was. The vast Arctic is a very small world.

It was to the slope of that most remote Ben Nevis that Charles would abscond with the Artifact. As it worked out, the thousands of square kilometers of North Spitsbergen that Gunnarr's family owned included Ben Nevis. Land said to have been acquired at gunpoint centuries prior. Gunnarr and Holger's forebears were swashbuckling. They were not people to be trifled with.

Their land had been at the center of numerous commercial schemes over the decades. They variously turned on coal extraction, sealing, whaling, reindeer herding, or, more recently, sounding rockets and ammonia distillation. Each generation had attempted some clap-trap project. Each had failed. The land was completely fallow. It seemed likely to always so be.

The Beskyttersens had expressed no opinion about a cranky Scott naming their mountain. Presumably, they had appreciated the free surveying. The family held on to their land carefully. Surveying was important. Each summer they ran a ship delivering goods to Longyearbien. It then sailed further up the north coast in a surveying and weather monitoring capacity. As routine as clockwork. The voyage would take five to ten days, typically.

At least once a decade a shore party would do a careful traverse. Their job was to plant and repair markers. Any sign of human disturbance would be reported to the authorities for follow-up. Overall, Spitsbergen was open, as was all Svalbard, but the Beskyttersens's land was private. That ownership and privacy was methodically maintained.

Gunnarr put Paul in touch with a woman in his Bergen operation, Signy Aslakssøn, who Gunnarr said could arrange most of the logistics of the plan. Signy in turn introduced the Beskyttersens's lands manager, Peter Kronenberg. Peter worked with his team and Legal to create a proposal for a weather station with satellite up and downlink. He pulled permits and waivers. The station wouldn't actually be built. The idea of it helped paper over a few extra landings. Later, if needs be, the plans could be pushed forward to screen activities.

Signy didn't want to know anything. She was polite and matter of fact. Frosty in the warmest possible way. And very effective. Paul and she worked out a flurry of landing craft drops scheduled over two years using ships out of Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Newfoundland. They scheduled two late-summer container landings. Last-minute, at season’s end, a break-bulk drop delivering transportation equipment, fuel bladders, and flat-pack construction materials. Charles would arrive from the south overland in December. He would bivouac rough till the weather broke. Then finish moving the landed supplies away from the coast before the next warm season.

Paul, Charles, and See See scouted ahead. To make that possible, several business trips and vacations were taken through bottleneck ports of call. Places where a traveler would stand out before they transshipped, as would any tail. They used charter transportation. Where possible they piggybacked on Karabiner shipments or Signy's routes to get to their charters. A tail would run the risk of being stranded.

CHRONOS's tradecraft was undoubtedly weak. Still, their puppy-dog enthusiasm for doing something – anything! – along with a metastasizing paranoia likely made up for what the individual tactics lacked. A frizzy wig with Groucho glasses and a bandana isn't subtle. It does hide your identity.

It was a frantic eighteen months. Soon enough, Charles died.

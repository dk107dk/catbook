***
Ten years after Aalasha Tanine, née Chesterian, left Low Fellside for Dalzell House she had become a very different person. The name Tanine weighed heavily on her. She had entered a world that revolved around Mac, Mac’s industrial estates, and Mac’s ambitions. Entered it, then held it stiffly at arms length.

House Tanine was not a world that understood or adjusted easily to the hands-on stochastic creativity of the Fellsman matriarchy. Aalasha turned inward. Who knows what that was like? Effusive communicator though she was, nobody on the River Clyde spoke Aalasha. Outwardly she became an even more unpredictable Highlands weather system. By turns regal, diffident, directive, and withdrawn. The best things that happened to her in that first Tanine decade, by far, were the births of Aalana and Paul.

And, likewise, for Aalana and Paul each was to the other the best part of a strained childhood in Dalzell House. To her credit, and yet her crushing dismay, as Aalasha's darkness grew, she grew the distance between herself and her precious children. And from that remove, she stood a tense watch. Whenever possible, standing between them and the ominous rumbles of their father.

"
In a formative moment the children stared at each other. About as bug-eyed as 9- and 10-year-olds can be without little fists flying. Three feet apart. On play-scarred knees. Hair mussed. Brows furled. Lips tight. Fighting flags flying from fighting kite strings.

Between them was a Monopoly board. The London version. There wasn't an Edinburgh version back then. It was an extra fancy set, of course. The cash was on Aalana Tanine's side of the board in neat denominations. Fake designs on a good facsimile of real paper. She had the little metal houses and hotels lined up like tiny shipping containers. Player pieces marshaled in a phalanx. Cards stacked dead center in their dashed squares. It was pretty clear who wanted to play The Bank. She was most qualified.

Where Aalana's face was determinedly grim, Paul Tanine's was more of a hurt kind of angry. Knees out. Leaning in. Not close to crying but you could see the potential lurking behind the clenched jaw. Fists dragging two heavy Erector Set I-beams back and forth on the rug. Of course, Paul had the heaviest, most expensive kit. He dragged the beams beside his legs autonomically. He risked the calamity of damaging the rug. This always happened! Aalana never played what he wanted. She always got her way. And her way was playing counting games where she would win. And she always did. It was insufferable!

The standoff was static. Neither child would have been willing to make more than a whisper. The microscopic thunder of I-beam on rug. Infinitesimal winds from 9-year-old hands waved in a mesoscale room. The freight railcar-thudding clunks of pewter house against brass hotel were lost in the rain on the windows, the twelve-foot drapes, and bottomless carpeting. Sound was the mutual assured destruction of the moment. In Dalzell House, sound was often an undue risk.

On the front side of the leather Chesterfield couch the children were behind there was a wide room. Large hearth. Tall windows. Floor to ceiling bookcases. Beside them to their right was an open double door. Carved dark wood frame. Ten glass panes with etched edgings. Polished brass door handles. Standing ajar to the second-floor Drawing Room. The opening let in the voices of Mackintosh Ioan Tanine's esteemed guests. Dinner had been delicious. Pipes and cigars. Brandy, scotch, port, sherry.

The voices offered drinks. They hemmed and opined. They harrumphed modestly in turn. They proposed thoughts cautiously. As they warmed to it, conversation flowed. Some laughter, some excitement, all still a bit guarded.

Mac's guests were trapping the children in the study behind the door and couch. It was a comfortable Irish bull session for the elder captains of local politics and industry. This was the Scottish version of the proverbial smoky backroom. Regulars knew to work their way around to things. Newcomers were invariably nervously excited to attend. They generally said the wrong words at the wrong moment.

For Aalana and Paul to be caught by the assemblage was an unusual strategic error. Were they discovered, there would be problems later on. Not rushing out at the first was a serious tactical blunder. They had already not been discovered for fifteen minutes or so. Consequential risk mounted with each minute. Being discovered sooner, if it had to happen, would have been better than later.

Aalana was the elder by eleven months. As their anxiety slowly blossomed, aggravating and then pushing out the annoyance, she took charge. She rolled the dice on the rug and moved the shoe silently. Landed on Bow Street. Disregarding the shortcomings of the neighborhood, she transacted with The Bank. In the other room, the actual bank softly clicked down his port on a side table.

Aalana mouthed to Paul, pointing at the street and the Erector Set.

"Build.

Paul got the idea. He immediately began construction without pulling permits. He did it very softly. Aalana passed him the cash for the new-build residential she had contracted. Paul was in business. Aalana calculated the rent. She rolled the dice for him, pointing. He chose the car. Aalana drove it off for him. Soon Paul had two houses to build. The builder’s efficiency became a concern. Money was not one. Neither were the usual Monopoly rules.

In the Drawing Room, the Lord-lieutenant was unaware that his regulatory authority was under threat in the next room from a renegade developer, an aspiring landlord, and their unblessed efforts at the gentrification of the brown and pale blue neighborhoods. Posh developments commanded more rent. Aalana instinctively preferred pricing-power. As a member of the Conservatives, he might well have been well disposed.

The after-dinner conversation was about unions and investment syndicates, steel nationalization and export markets. The adults’ talk filtered unconsciously through the two young brains in the background. Those brains were unaware they were being unintentionally groomed for their future years. To them, the topic of conversation in the next room was no great matter. So long as they weren’t discovered.

Aalana and Paul had quietly become quite busy. There were row houses to be built. Heavy industry to be tapped. Markets to be cornered. Rents to collect. An empire was being raised in toy steel and fake paper. Implicitly they were competing against the world. Together they intended to win the game.

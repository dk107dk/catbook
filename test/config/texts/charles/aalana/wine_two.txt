Aalana was where she knew she shouldn't be. A place she felt nobody should be discovered. She was in Mackintosh Ioan Tanine's personal space.

As his daughter, Aalana knew she was not exempt from his wrath. Just the reverse. Instinctively, as most of us do from a young age, Aalana knew that it was precisely because she was family that Mac would explode were he to walk into his smoking room and see her. Whereas were she a gentleman visitor, his annoyance might be restrained, or null. A man whose castle is his home does not welcome children invading his wing. Family is complicated.

Remarkably, Aalana saw fit to take the risk. Asked why, she might have given any of several answers. The long and short? She was there to get at his bottles.

Dalzell House was a cross between a fortified stately home and a straight-up castle. Most people called the old pile a tower house. It sported two large bartizan towers. Two smaller drum towers and a turret overlooked the walled arcade. Access to which was through crenelated parapets over a chemise with two strong horse gates connected by a circular way. Within those walls, a deep siege well was done up like a tiny chapel. The House was built over a massively terraced foundation platform. On the front, a vestigial moat.

The imposing central donjon rose four floors above its arcade, five above its platform, six or more above grade. The height was in part due to its footing on a terraced hill above the winding Dalzell Burn. On the four corners of the courtyard were slightly shorter living blocks. The left-hand side, facing front, being a single one-hundred-foot-long main wing.

One hundred and forty feet to the right a second u-shaped structure began. Similar to its sibling, but facing east. That part of the House was separated by a small atrium to let in light. It was a floor shorter and only one hundred and twenty feet wide. The northern courtyard was also paved. However, it was unfortified.

Overall, Dalzell was not a small abode. Far from it.

Above was a discordant jumble of architectural detail. The roofs of the main structure on the south were peaked from east to west with crow-stepped facades. Chimneys and vents. Windows and bridge gables. Skylights and small spires. Corbels and exposed beams. Lightning rods and flags. For the most part, these presented neatly. Much of the tumult was out of sight from below. The upper aspect of the north house, above the second courtyard, was much the same.

Within, the architectural details were such as to make Dalzell House a young person’s playground. Aalana and Paul lived in an embarrassment of pantries, minstrel pulpits, embrasures, priest’s holes, confessionals, solar rooms, nonfunctional garderobes, spiral vices, mullioned window seats with intricate stained glass dioramas, tiny mural chambers, and many other sorts of nooks. There were, indeed, hidden rooms and secret stairs.

In point of fact, while Dalzell House is an outlier, many homes have more rooms then are commonly used. Such homes often have a mysterious collection of keys. They hang on pegboards, hide in jars, are threaded on chains, wire or strings. Perhaps they all gravitate to the same top drawer. Some will have tape or tags. Most are anonymous. Who knows what they all do? Often times, nothing. But there is always that enticing thought: this might lead somewhere!

Dalzell House had an ever escalating riot of keys unaccounted for. The children collected them. Finding a new one, they rushed to try all the locks on all the hundreds of doors, closets, trunks, cabinets, wardrobes, sheds, gates, and the like. They did not, of course, share their findings with Rees. And of course, he had a similar collection. Finding a new member, he would undertake a similar, if slightly more sober-minded, round of investigations. Were parallels drawn, what would Rees have said?

Dalzell was not English. It was far from the striking stately homes of the South. It was not obviously built to impress or entertain. Nevertheless, it had a full complement of the usual chambers. They followed from a grand foyer with wide stairs through tall doors to a central saloon. Dining Hall, drawing rooms, billiards and smoking rooms. Libraries and studies. Morning and waiting rooms. Three kitchens of various sizes. Innumerable bedrooms, servant apartments, and attic quarters. Below ground, vaulted chambers, wine cellar, storerooms, and other niches. No dungeons, apparently. Though who knew what may have been back in the day? At the end of the northern courtyard, mews, orangery, workshops, stables, and other habitations.

It was a lot. For all this, only four staff members lived in the House. Additionally, the gardener, an under butler, a widowed cousin, and Jonsy occupied a row of apartments in a converted stable a few hundred feet up the back lane.

There were of course a number of day staff. Cooks, maids, and an on-call chauffeur. Mac kept a manager cum accountant nearby for impromptu consultation. The children had two tutors, with a rotating cast of instructors avocational. Among all these, Mac, Aalasha, Paul, Aalana, and Aalana's paternal grandmother, Mary Ann Tanine. Some years Mac’s sister Clare appeared for months at a stretch, occupying upper rooms without explanation. The Tanine manse was a small village during the day. Nevertheless, a sparsely populated one at night.

How did the they afford it all? By the 1960s, having passed through an industrial revolution, world wars, and sweeping globalization, the family had become a financial construct. Mac liked it that way. More refined, less refining. While an unsubtle man in person, including to family, he styled his activities on influence, not hammer and tongs. He ruled with brandy, port, and scotch. Dinner, fine wines, pipes, and cigars.

Mac was out doing Big Things. Aalana wanted a look at those fine wines. Rees guarded the wine cellar like it was his personal vault. So Aalana decided to brave a foray into the drawing, billiards, and smoking rooms. She liked to find things out under her own power. Bold questions came naturally. Private ascertainment and acquisition was her preference.

She was trying to understand wine and spirits better. The better that she and Jonsy could create fruit wines that would impress. Aalana was being groomed to impress. Why shouldn't her country wines be a part of that? Yes, they had absolutely become "her" wines, in her head. She thought them good. And she was beginning to like their taste.

"Jonsy, if this batch comes out good could we sell it? In bottles? Like in town or somewhere?

Jonsy was not a sophisticated man, to say the least. Selling things was what higher people did. His type, they bought. When they could afford to. Jonsy could no more imagine selling a local restaurant sommelier bottles of well-adorned country wine than he could imagine buying a luxury car or matriculating at Glasgow University. This was not lost on Aalana. She instinctively assumed she was the face of their country wine venture.

Jonsy give her a brief blank look.

"
The second-floor Drawing Room was dark wood. In style, mixed. A designer's eye would have caught the interference of neoclassical against modern within a pre-Victorian shell. Mac didn't see the contrast between the Robert Adam chairs and the Charles Rennie Mackintosh drinks cabinet. It wasn’t his thing. Both looked suitably posh. Certainly, the cabinet caught Aalana's eye in a way it never had before, the very few times she had encountered it.

She paused to listen to the House's voice. Dalzell spoke to her. It told her things no one else heard. The boards ached. The arches groaned under their load. The chill wind rushed up from the river Clyde. It clattered on the slates and leaded panes. A door banged distantly. The great clock ticked. Her tutor was long gone. Paul was away. Her mom was likely in the greenhouse or gardens. Mac surely off doing whatever he did. It was four-thirty. The rooms had already been straightened and dusted. There were long hours till dinner. No one was about.

What Aalana didn't realize was that Rees had been entering the foyer below just as she had slipped into the Drawing Room. He saw just the top of her head for just a second. Rees, however, noticed everything. It was his job to notice. And his inclination to spot disturbances.

He was disturbed that the child was entering Mac's masculine retreats. He was concerned that he had not seen her in this part of the house at this hour, ever? He felt a quiet that, in his experience, including at Dalzell House, most children don't engender. Where he was heading wasn't that important.

He paused. It was quite still. So. Rees thought he would enter the library. He could busy himself with a long-deferred project. Reorganizing books. It was slow and thoughtful work. And it made virtually no sound.

He ran his finger over the tops of the volumes. A gilt-edged |Romance of the Three Kingdoms| caught his eye. A story wherein a Chinese princess commits suicide by swallowing gold rings. And too, a first edition, in translation from the Egyptian Arabic, of |One Thousand and One Nights|. The embossed leather binding showing a Persian princess over the mot, |"Whoever speaks of what concerns him not, often hears what pleases him not."| Rees listened intently for sounds that might please him not. Eventually hearing slightly less silence passing above, he proceeded to the staircase.

Rees was not stealthy as a rule. He jaunted up the marble steps whistling. At the top, another pause. More soberly, he entered the world of serious men, as penciled out by Mac's rooms. They weren't the house's most familiar rooms to him either.

At the door of the Drawing Room he observed the familiar with discernment. There were two things to prevent: mischief and crime. Mischief might include objects obviously displaced, incidental damage, or the addition of dirt and grime. Crime, objects missing or consumed. He weighed all the things: lamps, canterbury, wall-mounted antique instruments, books, letters, letter opener, a globe, and many more sundries.

It was obviously the drinks cabinet. What else? Distressing, indeed. He would have to have a word with the mistress. If he knew her, and he knew he did, Aalasha would not be pleased.

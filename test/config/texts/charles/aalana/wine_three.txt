In a little remembered treatise tacked into the back pages of the Royal Botanical Society of Manchester's 1951 Annual Report a rather breathless young botanist argued that plants have a rich communitarian inner life. She elaborated a society of vegetation grounded in constant chemical conversations. Conversations that she claimed were profoundly multidimensional. Chemical and electromagnetic exchanges contextualized by somatosensory shadow mime. Together, not unlike semaphore or Morris code, but massively parallelized, several orders of magnitude slower, and highly symbolic.

Of the channels, the chemical language was described as faster and more predictable. Faster is relative. Cells divide relatively rapidly. They produce signaling chemicals less rapidly. Chemicals swell into botanical pulses that rise above the noise less rapidly still. The lubbing pulses travel the external environmental mediums, she declared, so slowly they often arrive out of sequence. Each pulse received is interpreted, at best approximately, by cells draped across what she described as a sappy band-gap.

Those receiving cells would then react by synthesizing their own molecular signaling. The import of their signals might have an impact within, without, or both. The botanical observer saw protocols incorporating lookups, indirection, and message forwarding. She found the process both ponderous and grand. Though not geological, it is, she wrote, decidedly slow. That is, unless you are yourself a plant.

Time is integral to the conversation. For the plant, the fledgling botanist exclaimed, the sun, the moon, and the stars pulse in a semblance of human vision or cinema. Rather than sixty frames per second, closer to a frame in six days. Leaves gradually extend and angle subtly. It is decided where branches are grown. Where they die. Where and when they fall. Flowers bloom, or they don't. According to the writer, the environmental constraints are forceful, metred, and richly matted.

And yet, she wrote in a burst of unacademic poetic cadence, there is ample room for choice, preference, inference, anger, and compassion. There is the ask and the response. The offer and the acceptance. Fertility and want. Barter without words. A hierarchy of voices is apparent: land, trees, brush, perennials, the ephemeral untethered chaff, and the ever-present high-frequency background noise, filtered from consciousness just as humans filter out the hum of their cities.

As described, indeed, a rich life. Such a life can be unpredictable. The enthusiastic young author would have, even back then, no doubt agreed.

For years, Aalasha listened to her garden daily. Most often she sat quietly in the greenhouses and hothouses clustered below the terraced hillside. Between the English plantings and the raised seedbeds that fed the Japanese garden. Sometimes she walked the arboretum. Perhaps pausing in its taller, tent-like shelters. She listened to the organized communities.

If she felt the need, she walked further, down to the Norway Yew stands, originally planted in the sixteenth century for the construction of military-grade longbows, now intermingled with local stock in an exuberant wild community. She liked the vigorous hubbub. Especially at times when the weather in the human world was dour, and the humans in it, rotten.

The Dalzell Estate was extensive. It was constantly changing. The groundskeeper was always busy. Pruning at the gates. Working with the tractor. Clearing drainage channels. And all the while overseeing the laborers hired to clear the burn, de-wood and open the paths, and mow the lawns. He negotiated with the farmers growing in the Estateâ€™s fields surrounding the wooded center. He engaged roofers to fix the slate, masons to repair the garden walls, landscapers to re-gravel the drives. He haggled with Rees to pay for it all. And he oversaw the head gardener and his two regular helpers, one of which lived on-site in a converted barn. He was indeed rather busy.

Aalasha helped in the garden. She was useful, if irregular. The gardeners gave her space. Her area of the hothouses and beds was better left undisturbed. Partly because, Aalasha. Partly because her choice of plants was concerning. At least to a person with a little knowledge of botany. Her work in the arboretum was a stronger contribution to easing their labors. She gave instructions, and she pitched in with the hard work. Eventually, though, she always retreated to her private garden within a garden.

One day, the flowers in her favorite hothouse were not where she expected them. This was all too human interference. Flowerpots and propagation trays don't arrange themselves. Sadly. Imagine the bandwidth!

Fittingly, and unsubtly the |Mentheae| were arranged such as to get her attention. They pointed to the inverted |Alstroemeria|. Juxtaposed on the left to a cascading curtain of |Dianthus Caryophyllus|, the Pink Carnation. This was clearly a warning. The children! This unseen interlocutor was not beating about the bush.

Her pulse raised steadily at each grim interpretation. The message was brief, pointed, somewhat overstated. At least she hoped it was. A chain hanging in a loop just so. A watering can with a bunched strawberry runner crammed on top of a blueberry branch. Her teeth gritted. The message unspooled innocently, invisibly in the controlled clutter of the grow stations and beds.

She composed herself. Counted her breaths. Removed her heavy canvas gardening apron. Washed the dirt off her hands. Smoothed her hair. She was certain what neophyte had been finger painting in her private place. She would see Rees immediately.

Aalasha was roiled. That was something the inhabitants of Dalzell House, from Mac on down, did their level best to avoid. It was done. There was going to be trouble.

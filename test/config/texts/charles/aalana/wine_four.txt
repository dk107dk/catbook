>1967 - Aalana observes a passing at Dalzell House

It was cold and damp. Aalana was standing in a small group. The group stood back from the reverend. He stood to the side of the open grave. Her mom stood catty-corner, half facing the knot of black garbed attendees. Rees stood stiffly. Groundskeeper beside him. Beside Aalana, two of the maids. Mac was not present. Nobody expected or wished for it.

The grave was in the Dalzell House family plot, some distance from the house. The plot was not often enhanced with new material. It was mostly full of centuries of overgrown Dalzell graves. Along with those of their closest extended family and servants. The Lairds Dalzell and their wives and children had impressively large headstones, obelisks, and sarcophagi. Or they were interred in the small chapel crypt. The crypt was badly in need of care.

With the Tanines's much shorter incumbency, the family graves were clustered in a small area at the far right from the gate. They bore characteristic duality: brutalism inscribed with beautiful tracings. An artistic recessive gene survived the generations. Nevertheless, the overall impression was cold.

The black stone was sharply cut in gross geometry. It was polished to a dimly reflective surface. Up close, the inscriptions were inlaid in understated shades of coin and ferrous metals. Tiny rivers, visible only at angles. Who lay there and when they died was apparently less important than that they were overbearingly a member of House Tanine.

At the margins, artisans had engraved infinitesimal points and tendrils. Brilliant shades of silver-white and silver-blue. From a distance, intransigent black hulks. Up close, from certain angles, an almost baroque mirage of light. Deadly light. Each stone was a cornucopia of heavy metals. A bad idea to touch, let alone ingest. Not than anyone would, but how very Tanine!

Regardless, Jonsy's grave was much nearer the front. It was the commonest ground in an uncommon cemetery, with a commoner's modest stone. Jonsy's everlasting position had been improved by circumstance. He was only buried in the family soil for two reasons. Explicitly, his father had been Mac's late father's most trusted confidant among his domestic employees. Less overtly, Aalasha wanted it so. And so, it was.

Aalana was not crying. Nor had she when she heard Jonsy had died. She listened to recitals that made no impression. She observed her mother. The ceremony conveyed information abundantly. First: Aalasha wasn't sad, despite her insisting on a preferred interment. And second: she didn’t give a damn who knew it. The import of this fact, and all its antecedents, would slowly surface over time. As it was entirely meant to.

"
Over the years, Aalasha and her children had slowly become distant. While the thought of corrupting their childhoods with her melancholy made her gut clench; nevertheless, Aalasha yearned to give Aalana and Paul something. Despite her every attempt, their upbringing was steadfastly so unlike her own. She spent her childhood making things, exploring spaces, and investigating the tactile universe of cause and effect. Aalasha had never been told what to do or overtly restricted. She had had no society to impress other than a farm and cottage factory.

Her children were instead wrapped in layers of servants, ceremony, and abstract learnings. Dalzell House was fundamentally about abstractions, not the physicality of life. Politics, tables of statistics and the periodic table were all very well, Aalasha supposed, if they animated things and communed with nature. At Dalzell House, they manifestly did not.

Paul had responded to her attempted alloys of lessons and play. Aalana, less so. She was bookish, symbolic, and analytical. She would handle transactions well. She was less likely to make the value of those transactions come alive with her own hands. And this felt important to Aalasha. Where some would see a budding knowledge worker, Aalasha saw a glaring gap in her daughter’s upbringing.

Ultimately, it was impossible to resist the influence of Tanine ways in Tanine’s house.

For that reason, Aalana's experiments in brewing, once discovered by Aalasha, were at first welcomed. She turned a blind eye. She made space. However, the impact Rees had described in childlike floriography was not so easy to condone. Substance abuse was something she feared. It was both sad and exploitable. She had seen it. It wasn't for her, and certainly not for her children.

Aalasha had observed Mac across the dinner table for many years. How many times had he taken advantage of a guest that was unable to help themselves? It was subtle. Glasses were fractionally larger for certain guests. Tiny gestures called to refill without asking, without regard for protests, should there be any. Portions of the main course were served slightly smaller. Richer wines selectively provisioned. Toasts were calculating. Individuals so handicapped were at a severe disadvantage.

And yet, for manipulation, alcohol seemed to her a blunt instrument. Aalasha knew better. She knew ways to slow thought to any metronome tick. To distort reality. To cause sensitivity to light, noise, touch. To degrade the body in a dozen ways. To depersonalize and even kill. The means were legion. And some, impalpable. Biology is so easily weaponized. It was an obsession that Aalasha had cultivated since childhood.

Aalasha had slowly seen her world shrink from wide valleys and busy villages to a stiff framework of gentry proprietaries. Under that pressure, her secret worlds of herbary and sematology expanded commensurately. Were Mac to realize her chemical capabilities, he would have demanded her assistance. Abhorrent to think of! Were he attuned to the private language Aalasha used at dinner, his head would have detonated.

"
At one in the morning, Aalana wasn't sleeping. She got up and went for a walk. Aalana could easily walk up and down the six floors and around and around the two courtyards without any chance of meeting anyone or waking a soul. In fact, for all she knew, Paul might be up doing the same. That wouldn’t have surprised her.

Presently, she came to the minstrel's pulpit on the fourth-floor gallery above the main saloon. This was where one or a few players would have serenaded a social gathering, dance, or dinner. A space out of a different age. It was an effort for her to imagine the greater colors, the candlelight, the costumes of a society consumed by history with little trace.

It was also a good spot for staking out the haunts of the so-called Ladies Green, White, and Gray. A.k.a Unrequited, Too Requited, and Requisitioned. The first was a lovelorn suicide. The second was a death out of wedlock. The third, a broken-hearted World War I nurse. All colorful stories that helped constitute the texture of Dalzell House. Aalana was certain there must have been dozens more such characters. The house was half a millennium old, for goodness sake!

The great room was particularly known to be the sanctity of the Green Lady, or Unrequited. By kitchen accounts, the Green Lady was a |glaistig| spirit of ambivalent nature. One in a long Gaelic tradition of chlorophyllic |maighdean uaine|, protecting or prowling Scottish piles. She was, hands down, Aalana's favorite.

The Green Lady was said to take the form a comely young woman wrapped in oriental silks of Egyptian or Persian design who would rush atmospherically into the hall or to the front gate or the master guest room in the hopes of finding her erstwhile suitor waiting. She was never satisfied. Distraught, she would then make a theatrical weeping sigh or a scream of despair, thankfully soundless. And finally, flourish an invisible phial, take a drought, and vanish even as she fell. Quite a show!

Sadly, the Green Lady was not a presence Aalana had actually encountered. There had been times when one of the numerous mirrors or chandelier crystals had flashed an unexpected green glow in the darkness. Surely that had been the Lady. However, her chasing after emerald auras hadn't amounted to much. Coming upon the so-called suitor would also have been interesting. Marmy in the kitchen had said his name might have been Robertson. Aalana would have had sharp words.

Aalana didn't believe in ghosts. Despite that, she did believe in the three ladies. She just taxonomized them differently. She saw them as guests. Welcome to reside forever. She felt beholden to be a good host. And occasionally a bit frustrated to not know what that really meant – Aalasha not being the best model. Ideally, they would talk. She would commiserate. Maybe brighten their nights with parlor games. So far, she hadn't had the chance to try.

On this night she sat in the dark and had a think. She was no more concerned by Jonsy's interment than she would have been if the Green Lady had sat down beside her and scowled. He was gone. She hadn't seen him much lately. Servants eventually left. People eventually died. There were reasons. Such is life. In her social stratum one strives to remain unaffected by situations.

Nevertheless, something was worming in her mind. Unlike the aforementioned ghosts, it wasn't something she could share with Paul. Much less Aalasha. Her mom wasn't grounded in direct talk and nurturing answers. Aalana and her father didn't go beyond superficial dinner chat. It occurred to her, she would need to find a new Jonsy before she would have someone with whom she could relate the loss of Jonsy. That was a bother.

What Aalana would have wished for, she realized, was to actually have the Green Lady appear. And for Unrequited to for once be a little less self-absorbed. Perhaps she could help Aalana unravel the tangle she was picking at.

There were many threads. Jonsy had at a certain point become distant. She had felt him draining away. One day he was not there and she didn't know why. He had become busy with handyman's tasks. Unusually busy for someone who usually flew so far under the radar.

Illness was partly to blame for his distance. Aalana had noticed a few months ago that her mom had become solicitous after Jonsy's health. He had taken ill before the holidays. It was odd that her mom had noticed. That was new. In the usual case, Jonsy was invisible. And Aalasha wasn't one to notice any of her staff much in any event. She had Rees for that. And yet that winter Aalasha was involved. And so Rees was careful to facilitate Jonsy's convalescence and make a show of sympathy.

Rees Aalana liked, even though he was a phony. So phony you couldn't tell if he was a cad. So phony you had to like him. Rees would not typically talk to Jonsy. It was propriety. For the Head of House to stoop the least reputable nebbish was just not done. And yet, there he was, engaged. At least until Jonsy was back in action three weeks later. Then all went back to being basically normalish.

Their country wine had for some reason gone bad. In part due to the cellar being locked for weeks during the illness. Jonsy's preoccupations didn't help. And one week the stove in the orangery needed work. A skilled workman couldn't be had. The fruit froze. The trees became infertile and grew strangely in vaguely threatening poses. The space was never as warm again.

And then, and then, and then. There was more. She tried to pull at the insubstantial threads. They broke. But gosh what a tangle there were. She had been packed away by one of her tutors on a fortnight's visit to Edinburgh to make an extensive study of the collections of the Royal Scottish Museum. Unusually closely chaperoned. By the time she returned with her head full of science and industry Jonsy was again ill. It came and it went. And at a certain point she realized that Aalasha was involving herself again. Rather a lot.

She had had a conversation with Rees.

"Hey, GPB, why is mother helping the maids and Marmy take care of Jonsy?

GPB stood for Grand Poobah. Nobody else would dare go there with Rees. But he indulged his girl Lana.

"Your mother remembers Jonsy's father's service to your grandpa. That means a lot to the Family. Jonsy may not be of stature, for reasons, but he is a good heart, as they say. I’m sure that’s it.

Aalana thought this sounded unlikely at the time. However, attempting to dig below the surface sheen with Rees in the past had elicited a grand total of nothing worth remembering, except that the attempts hadn't ever been worthwhile. She let it drop.

One day, Aalana had come into the kitchen to filch something tasty, if she could get away with it. Suddenly it had become crowded. Marmy was preparing a lunch for the tutors and Mac's accountant person. She and her assistant were also fixing prep for dinner. The under butler was lending a hand by gathering a basket for Jonsy, who was again unwell, seemingly mainly to try to get his hands on some fresh bread.

And then Aalasha waltzed in looking ever so distracted, head-in-clouds, as usual. Her presence in the kitchen was not at all usual. She took an interest in Jonsy's soup. Which seemed odd. She had tasted it and sprinkled a little pepper or spice or something on it. And then one of the maids had whisked it away down the lane. And Aalana had promptly dematerialized up the hall in a wave of my-mind-is-fully-elsewhere.

This was the main thread Aalana had got a hold of. Pulling it was only tightening the knot. Three days later, Jonsy had been dead. And there was no Green Lady available to discuss it with. Eventually, Aalana moved on. Some things, though, she never forgot.

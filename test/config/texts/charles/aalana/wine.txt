>1965 - 1966 - Aalana's venture in Motherwell

Jonsy's knuckles flushed in bright colors as the temperature dropped. His eyes went rheumy. Facial hair grew into a feral kitten clawing at his wide, wrinkled face. Jonsy didn't fare well in the cold.

Most of the time his hands were as stained as his pants. Coal soot, hinge oil, or fruit wine precursors were equally likely. When not engaged in repairs or portage, he wore a leather apron. It smelt sticky and staggered on the line between fermentation and spoilage. Personal grooming was not a strength. For the most part, Dalzell House just dealt with it.

His name was Laurie. Everyone called him Jonsy. They did so out of respect for his long-deceased father, Mister John Jones, former Majordomo to Robert Tanine. Many years later, Jones Senior's shoes were about worn out. Jonsy could not have afforded a new pair so fine.

For going on thirty years as a factotum Jonsy had kept grounds at Dalzell House. If anyone had bothered to ask, that is likely what they would have been told. However, he was never actually a groundskeeper, |per se|. Nor was he in kitchen or personal service. Jonsy was mainly a kind of handyman without portfolio. While not exceptionally handy, he was always near at hand, willing, and resourceful. He was quiet, attentive, and took instruction. His upkeep was marginal and priced into the household expenses as a factor to petty cash and coarse food. He had a small apartment above the storerooms up the lane. There wasn't much in it.

Aalana had occasionally spied on Jonsy since, well, forever. At nine she had remembered a moment. Him shooing her away. She thought it had been when she was about six. He had been struggling to get a cart through the narrow passage between the back kitchen and the mews. She had been chasing one of the dogs. There was dark liquid on the tarp. The dog sniffed and barked. Jonsy kicked. He huffed and growled. She should play in the garden.

"Stand back lassie. I have to get these pigs to the block. Away with yer. Away.

Years later after the truth of the moment was lost she remembered wondering why he was pushing the cart away from the very kitchen where the heavy food prep was done. And why so urgent for her to be gone and him to be off? Might he have been up to something? She constructed narratives to explain why she remembered a moment that was well and truly lost long before she became nine. Oh, the imagination of children.

"
Over time Jonsy mellowed and Aalana became less easily shooed by adults. One day she went to the orangery. It was February. She was tired of the Saturday silence and chill. Mac was skulking back and forth between the library and his office. Father, so-called because other more endearing names hadn't stuck, was working. His own noises were the only ones he welcomed. The orangery would be more peaceful, warm, and empty. Or so she hoped. It almost was, other than Jonsy.

In the sweep of the house's history, the orangery was new. Mac had converted a section of the outer courtyard's attached buildings a few years after Aalasha and he took over Dalzell. It was another way for Aalasha to escape winter. The other greenhouses and hothouses were not high enough for even small trees. Aalasha had never been as fond of trees as she was of smaller more useful plants. That left the orangery somewhat neglected. Jonsy had slowly become its main minder. He liked the heat.

The orangery was stone, glass, and brick. Twenty-five by thirty-five feet. The conversion raised its already generous height more than six additional feet. Convex copper panels rose up to a peaked roof lantern with decorative flashing. Tall, many-paned windows were cut into the original stone-block walls. The back wall was plain brick. It ran in front of the outer wall, leaving a narrow alleyway with coal bins and corded wood for the stove.

Aalana slipped into the quiet hothouse through the narrow servant's corridor that ran from the main house along the back wall of the outer courtyard buildings. The stove was always lit to keep the plants warm despite the draft-prone glazing. The windows were fogged. Rain on the ceiling glass. Aalana had brought pillows and cushions to her hideout over time. They were piled behind the last row of trees and growing tables. There were books. At two in the afternoon it was already dim. She was asleep before she knew it.

When she woke Aalana could tell she wasn't the only one in the orangery. A single sodium lamp on the other side of the growing floor made a shadowy light through the fruit trees. The iron stove's glass and vents glowed. Someone was moving about. Presumably in the garden workshop. The workshop was a narrow room at the house end of the orangery. It was for potting, seedlings, tools, and materials. Aalana got up, stretched, and went to see.

Living in what amounted to a castle with often cranky adults doing Very Important Things makes one stealthy by nature. Aalana came up to the workshop door. It was ajar. The light was a pale combination of red sodium and blue/green fluorescence from the grow racks. She heard water running. Looking in, it was Jonsy. He had the slops sink tap running into a bucket. Cupboards and bench doors open. A barrel press in the middle of the floor with buckets. The door to the downstairs was open at the back.

Aalana rapped on the door and boldly marched in.

"Hi Jonsy. What 'cha doing?

Jonsy startled. He dropped a metal arm. Turned rapidly looking up. Caught a cupboard door to steady himself.

"Oh, aye, Lana. You surprised me. Where are you coming from then?

Aalana wasn't to be deterred.

"What 'cha doing? Looks like you’re making stuff?

Jonsy had his feet and torso sorted out. He straightened his back. Looked at his hat lying on the bench. Pushed his unruly hair back. He was breathing hard as some do when they are more focused on an effort than they are on breathing enough to make the effort. He picked up the metal arm. It was an iron press handle with a wooden grasp. Vine-like ornamentation on a graceful curve. He held it out.

"Well then, I'm putting this handle on this press.

Aalana had sort of figured that part out.

"Yes, but what's it you're making?

Jonsy was not really a cranky sort of adult. He was gruff. He could ramble. More often he was short. Mostly he seemed to want to not be noticed. Aalana knew he would answer her questions. She suspected he might not tell her to go away. If he didn't she might stay and maybe learn something.

"I'm fixing to juice some fruit harvest. The press is sticking. I need to get the handle mounted.

Aalana had seen the press used. And she had helped with berry grinding in the kitchens with similar but smaller rigs.

"Can I help? I know how to grind. What are we making?

Jonsy laughed and coughed.

"We, eh? Hmmph. We are making fruit wine. Seems you just signed up for hard labor. Let me tell you what you do.

That was how Aalana started learning about wine. And it was how she started hanging out with Jonsy. An odd couple, if ever there was one.

"
At the start, Jonsy told Aalana about how to grow and harvest fruit. Which kind made what type of beverage. He grew grapes, plums, and pears inside. Occasionally he tried experiments like clementines or pineapple. Blackcurrant and apples grew outside, in season. He showed her rows of small barrels in the cellar below the orangery. She learned about presses, demijohns, and oak barrels, pulp, tannins and acidity. They planted, fixed implements, and cleaned equipment together.

"Little Lana Bird, this is where you have the advantage over me.

Aalana had small, supple hands. She was able to clean the press taps more easily than Jonsy. He appreciated the help. It was all of it interesting. Much more fun than French, maths, or philosophy. Aalana liked the mechanics of making stuff. The practicality of producing things you could hold in your hand, be it a tool or fruit or jug.

When Aalana got home from the Dalziel School in the afternoons she had schoolwork. She did it quickly in the upper kitchen, the back study, or one of the dozens of nooks in the keep. Then she headed to the orangery for a practical education in horticulture and vinification.

When Aalasha noticed her daughter's activities, she approved of her spending time in the orangery. At first, she had no idea about the winemaking. She gave her children space with intentionality. Aalasha herself spent a large part of her time in the nursery on the garden side of the estate. Also, the Japanese garden, outside, when the weather was good. Like mother, like daughter.

Aalana was curious about their product. Jonsy gave her her first taste of fruit wine. It was a black and blue, a blend of blackcurrant and blueberry. That was only a couple of months after she had started helping him. The particular batch was little more than a hard fruit juice. Nevertheless, it was a risky thing for him to do. Aalasha would undoubtedly not approve. Nobody crossed Aalasha. Jonsy steered well clear of her, mostly. But for Lana he took the chance.

"Jonsy, Father was talking about an expensive wine at dinner. What makes a wine expensive?

Jonsy paused. Rees Morgan, Dalzell's head butler, had the keys to the cellars. Jonsy knew nothing much about serious wines. He knew little about what went on in rooms Mac was in. Mac knew Jonsy by sight. He didn't know what he did. Jonsy knew Mac would not approve of him fraternizing with one of his children. Moreover, Jonsy had little concept about money above the amount he was likely to find on his dresser. He wished he found more there. That was about it.

"A wine's age is important. If it's the right wine, and you do it right, the value goes up year by year.

Aalana wasn't exceptionally curious about the cost of wines. She did wonder what her parents would say about Jonsy's homemade brew. Her expectation was that it was a subject best not raised at dinner, if at all. At least not until she applied herself to its achieving overwhelming impressiveness; which, being a Tanine, she was casually certain it would. Likewise, the Tanine side of her brain could imagine her father might approve of her venture, when it finally caught his attention. Tanines are, shall we say, an optimistic bunch.

"Oh, kind of like an antique. What makes a wine the right kind?

Jonsy was replacing a ballast in one of the grow lights. They were working on setting up a station for a crop that was new to them, strawberries.

"Our kinds aren't right, lass. We make country wine. Fine wine is grapes. It comes from warmer places then Scotland. Fancy places. Country wine is everything else. Fruit wine. Apples, pears, blackcurrants. Who knows? Maybe even strawberries. You can't age country wine. Just hafta drink it.

The discussion at the next such dinner had been more interesting than Aalana had realized. Dalzell House entertained virtually every week. Generally, at least one invited dinner. Two or three nights, cocktails, or social visits. Cigars and pipes. In the summer, lawn sports, chamber music, tastings, falconry. Aalana and Paul were for the most part exempt from the calendar. Their duties extended to being briefly charming and scarce.

Mac was concerned that an upcoming dinner party at Dalzell House would have a guest list that would achieve an end. To that end, |inter alia|, fine wines. The end was this: Mac wanted to see a particular bank chairman support an amalgamation. The all-stock merger of a small firm with a big one. The small firm was way out of its depth, due to indirectly owing Tanine Holdings companies a kettle-tonne of debt. The larger firm was majority-owned by one of Mac's rivals. Mac’s full perspective on the deal was not widely perceived.

The small company's debt had a low probability of being money-good. Mac wasn't in it to be paid back. Neither was he interested in a charitable contribution. He had carefully arranged this particular debt in order to, at the right time, exercise a little-appreciated clause: the Tanine debt optionally converted to ordinary voting shares at the time of any merger, acquisition, recapitalization, or bankruptcy. Bank Chairman willing.

Through proxies, Mac had amassed 18.3% of the voting shares of his competitor. Were the deal to complete, he hoped to gain another 2.2%. With the additional equity would come the standing to move a shareholders' motion requiring a vote of the Board. And in combination with his proxies, jointly having effective control of the Board, the ability to settle the vote according to his interests.

What those interests were, Mac wasn't saying. He played his cards close to the vest. Most of his intendants and advisors didn't know. Few were even aware of Mac’s machinations. What was clear to all, though, house staff included, was that fine wine was a necessary, but not sufficient, initial condition for whatever it was that Mac was up to.

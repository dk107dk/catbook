>1973 - Aalana turns her back on Dalzell House

It was getting on towards lunchtime. Rees was pacing. As Head of House, and a generally calming presence, pacing was something new. He had floated serenely through difficult births, unusual deaths, the grinding down of Aalasha's marriage, the kids’ sometimes rocky upbringing, which he prided himself he had helped keep on a somewhat even keel, to Paul's explosive disaffection and, as Mac saw it, absconsion. Now, this. It wasn't Mac he was worried about. The old bugger probably wouldn't blow up. But Aalasha? It was possible her compression might go supercritical.

That would be a problem for Rees. Despite everything, he was still at Dalzell House after these many years mainly because of his fascination with the glamorous, reclusive, discombobulatedly ethereal hairball of strange that was the mistress of the house. Now that the children were gone, she was his main service and preoccupation. He was a little afraid of her. He didn’t want to see a meltdown. He could not predict if that was in the offing.

Aalana was coming home. She was bringing a young man. She requested the presence of Mac, Aalasha, Klade, and Rees himself. He knew, to a degree, what she was up to. Mother and daughter had at some point learned to communicate with Rees. Or, rather, he had years ago begun to understand how they been constantly trying, whilst not really expecting him to understand. Rees realized he was virtually illiterate, deaf, and mute. As he began working to undo his deficit he became, thenceforth, unquestionably involved.

In this case, though, Aalana had simply phoned Rees with her requirements. A formal lunch. An introduction to the family of her beau, Voight Schiller. The family, broadly defined, such as remained. Four full-time inhabitants of a cold, echoey, half millennium-old pile on a glowering hill above the River Clyde. Each following a path that transversed but rarely met. Each in their own way, a coldly manipulative, secretive son of a gun. Well, self-excluded. He operated meticulously, for sure, but he was not Tanine. Even after all those years.

Nothing was coming to a head today, he told himself, not believing it. Aalana was headstrong. She wasn't asking for permission, she was informing. Good on her. Afterward, that was another matter. China often looked strong until the moment it came apart. Usually at the worst possible time, say, as hot soup was being ladled. He shuddered to think.

"
"Sir, the car is arriving.

The under butler stood expecting instructions.

"Thank you Jacks. I'll see them in. You double-check that the housekeeper has the rooms ready. Then fetch their luggage.

Ryan Jacks was a good man. Increasingly underemployed. For now, that was fine. Good men were hard to find. Better to keep all he had. Perhaps a new generation would need them. Perhaps someday soon. Rees hoped. At least he thought he did. Some days he wasn’t sure.

"At once. I'll wait in the library afterward unless you need me elsewhere?

Rees did not. His staff knew their business. Jacks would stand by where he could be unobtrusively useful with drinks and any requests. The car from the city would be at the gate. Rees would meet Aalana and judge this paragon of manhood for himself. Their rooms would be ready. He would make the young man welcome. Rees assumed he would not be someone well versed in Scottish castle living. That was, sadly, for the best.

"
"Welcome home mistress Aalana. We've missed you terribly, if I may say so. Edinburgh University's loss is decidedly our gain.

Rees was stiff with both tradition and the attempt to overcome it.

"Rees, you're an old premodern relic, but I love you anyway. My name is not mistress. This fellow's name is Voight Schiller. He's from Boston. In the US. You are to treat him superbly, you hear?

Voight looked bemused. He was having trouble not swiveling his head six different ways taking in the overawing fact of Dalzell House. He had been warned. It had not worked at all. Voight, with an effort, focused back on Rees. Rees was about to welcome him. He was not fast enough.

"It's great to meet you, Mister Rees. I've heard a lot about you. And about this amazing place. Seriously, I've never seen anything like it. Wow. I can't wait for you to give me a tour. I want to see everything!

The last part was to Aalana. Rees, though, thought he might take the first pass at playing tour guide. He had appreciated the few Americans he had encountered over the years. An odd breed. Definitely amusing. This one seemed fun, if oddly unfamiliar with hereditary forms of address. He ushered the couple in.

"Your rooms are ready. Jacks will bring your luggage up directly.

Aalana was more animated than he remembered seeing her in years. This was good.

"Where have you got us stashed, Rees? Somewhere in deepest castley, I hope. I want to blow this chap's mind. I'll bet we can do that, can't we!

Rees noted the way Lana was already adulterated with Americanisms. Jolly good too. He was laughing inside. It felt good, finally.

"I'm sure we can arrange that Mis... Lana.

Rees winked at Voight. He instinctively assumed Voight had at least a primitive understanding of the protocol that was being shattered like cracked Wedgwood at the fair. Then again, perhaps not. Aalana had explained that Voight’s mother was a Welsh radical, and his father was from Germain-Belgian burghers. That, and growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, meant he could be assumed to be clueless. Having now met him, Rees could see her point.

"You're in the Garden of Roses. And sir is adjacent in Greek Isles.

He elaborated for Voight's sake.

"These are well-appointed rooms in the guest quarters. On the third floor of the Keep. Right above the Saloon. Top shelf, naturally. Nothing but the best for family.

He continued filling in the cracks as they walked.

"You must understand if Lana hasn't already explained. She and Master Paul had no fixed address when they were growing up. Dalzell House has more than fifty rooms on six floors. Their parents saw fit to let them take up residence in whatever suite took their fancy. Perhaps the hardest part of my job was keeping track of where they were camping at any given time.

Voight was eating this up. And looking around so carelessly Rees was loath to use the tower stairs. It wouldn't do to have the guest of honor take a tumble before lunch.

"I'm totally knocked out. I thought Lana was making half this stuff up. Towers, ghosts, and dungeons. Too crazy. I would have loved to grow up here!

Rees got them safely to their rooms. No, they didn't need anything more. Then lunch was to be in the dining room in an hour, sharp. Lana had, after all, said formal, and so it would be. He promised a grand tour after lunch. His guess was Lana wouldn't wait. But she also couldn't give Voight the overwhelming sense of history Rees could deliver effortlessly. First, however, they had to survive lunch.

Nevertheless, it was already abundantly clear: Miss Aalana was leaving for America. There wasn't a damn thing her parents could do about it, should they wish to. Rees's heart lifted. He was glad. His girl Lana was out.

"
Later that night Aalana and Voight left the UK prematurely in the rain. It came before they arrived in Manchester. Their black cab pulled up at departure after the M53 from City Centre where they had expected to have a going-away dinner with Paul. It was pouring. Their flight was at nine on the BEA Trident, connecting through London. The main leg would be a BOAC widebody overnight to Boston. A little rain wasn't going to keep Aalana from getting the heck out of Dodge.

Paul had not been able to make the dinner. He called the restaurant at the last minute. This turn of events was not exactly new. That Aalana would not be returning to Britain for twenty years was. If she had known, no doubt she would have been more annoyed still. Had Paul known he probably still wouldn't have shown up. As it was, Aalana crabbily checked her assumption with Voight that it rained roughly twice as often in Manchester as at their destination. Voight was noncommittal. That was not his best play. Aalana became even more bloody annoyed.

"
It had started hours before. As requested, Rees had stood them a dress-lunch for four, Klade and himself having bowed out, as was appropriate. He was to make sure Mac and Aalasha would both be present. That had not been an easy request. The logistics were challenging, given Rees had to work through both Klade and Mac's secretary to make sure, first, that nothing else was scheduled, and, second, that someone important would be expected, but who would back out at the last minute. Why would Klade get his hands dirty in this charade? Rees thought, solidarity with the family. That was naive.

Klade was, nevertheless, pleased to assist. It was obvious to him what game was on. He was by this point personally in favor of Tanines being widely separated from Chesterians. Aalana fell on the better-gone side of the ledger. While a member of House Tanine, it was not for sure she was truly a member of Team Tanine. It wasn't that Klade had, at that time, any particular designs. Rather, he was of the opinion that family business was not meant to be cricket, and rightly so. His allegiance was to Mac and the House operations. His blood was up on the question of how loyal Aalasha and her parents were. And he wanted something from them. And he didn't even know what it was. And that rankled. Better gone. To Klade, the fastest means to separating Aalana from Dalzell House, obviously, was to situate her as close to Mac as possible. How could he help?

Lunch had gone poorly. For starters, while Rees's risky play worked – Mac was there in person – it had the unfortunate side effect that Mac was intrinsically out of sorts. Rees had hoped the presence of the sparkling conversation of Voight, an Antwerpen of a notable family, to say nothing of being his daughter's beau, would more than make up for the last-minute loss of the presence of the Lord Provost's ambitious nephew, Joch Cochrane.

Joch was attempting to raise excitement for the reconstitution of his Tobacco Lord forebear's Political Economy Club. His enthusiastically embraced roots in his family's increasingly disreputable history swept aside, Mac was eager for Joch to be obliged. With his absence, that would not be possible. Mac was annoyed. There was no dish on offer to balance. His secretary would hear of it.

Given that start, the meal was not the ideal forum. Perhaps Aalana should have anticipated that. And perhaps she did. Perhaps Rees should have advised differently. Maybe? Aalasha had known, though at what point who could say. Aalasha always knew. Certainly long before any such intrigue could manage to roil that cast of characters.

She might have settled the matter herself. Aalasha could still command a quorum with a fair certainty of success. But she did not. Rees did what he could and it was insufficient. He was quietly mortified. Voight, thoroughly an American, noticed nothing. His father, Baron Arthur Stahl von Schiller, would have sussed the signs in a trice. His mother, Amber Anthracythe-Schiller, would also have noticed nothing, largely because she didn't do formal lunches in castles with the British equivalent of robber barons.

Aalana gave every indication she was insensitive to the undercurrents. She was not. She was, however, in a form for her lately rare at Dalzell House: sparkling. And in due course, the somewhat asymmetric discussion of her and Voight's lives and future resulted in the news of the day. Voight sat up straighter. Looked Mac in the eye warmly and let him know he intended to take his daughter as his bride. Aalana approved of this very manly display of virtue. She had coached him, though it wasn't her thing. Her hope was that it connected with Mac, man to man, so to say. Voight had taken notes and performed well.

Aalasha greeted the news equally warmly, after the fashion of warm expressed by eccentric mistresses of castles in the damp hills upland to the east of Glasgow. Her smile was genuine. She said little, verbally. Her back remained straight. In the private language of Aalasha she was effusive.

"Prince Charming is a sweetheart. Not a huge hit with your father, though, and I love him for it! You found a good man. You'll be very happy together. We must conjure up a most fairytale wedding for you. And later, I will come to stay with you in Cambridge for a while when you two bring me a beautiful grandchild to hug. That day will be soon, I hope!

Aalana stammered happily. She missed this, her old mom, the one from her earliest memories. She replied in a foreign language gladly attempted.

"We, we will very soon. Come stay soon, I think. You should very come!

They continued for a few minutes this way, ignoring the men. Aalana had never been completely fluent in Aalasha. Her mom compensated by communicating slowly. It was the most the two had spoken for years. In the end, their train of thought was broken by the silence from the male side of the long table, and by Voight's staring at them wide-eyed. Mac was busy with his roast beef and had little more to say. As far as he was concerned his lunch was a few bites from done and it needed attending to.

Not many hours later, Aalana and Voight's still-packed bags found their way into one of the big dark saloons. They soon pulled off through the gate towards town. Thanks to Mac, and the temper his and Aalasha's genes bequeathed their daughter, already low expectations had suffered a fall. Aalasha watched the car disappear from a tower room. Her finger tips went pale from the pressure. They streaked blood on the sill. She never left her island.

After only a week in the land of her birth, and two days less than expected at home, Aalana was happy to depart, even if they ended up waiting at the airport for their late evening flight. Rees called Paul himself to let him know the couple was coming down directly. He arranged tony reservations for dinner, even though four hours was not much notice for Paul. Rees had hoped his fugal orchestration hadn't been his second poor showing of the day. Sadly, it was.

"
Having passed security at departure, Voight had pulled his carry-on to a bench while Aalana was finishing up with the gate. She was apparently the kind of ne'er-do-well that required additional questioning. Voight was straightening up when he unexpectedly heard Aalana Tanine called to the BEA service desk. That was outside the gate. Right as Aalana came through Voight spun her around and walked her out. More annoyance was added to the bill of particulars.

Oddly, at the desk, they were confronted by a bubbling Mrs. Cheveley in a large blue and white full-length silk dress with embroidered chiffon shawl and long pale pink gloves. She came running. Her eighteenth-century lace hat flew off her head as she rushed up. Out of breath, hair half pinned, and seriously out of place. As was all of her.

"Dearest Aalana! Good sir Schiller. So brilliant to make your acquaintance! Please come with me.

Aalana wasn't sure she had in fact properly made anyone's acquaintance. The credible curtsey was welcome enough, she supposed.

"Well, likewise, good to meet you too. And you are?

Koni Athair got a look on her face as if she had forgotten her manners. That was a fair assessment.

"Oh, my goodness. You may call me Lady Cheveley, at your service.

Jampheto Maths arrived on the scene. He had retrieved Koni's lace hat. Dressed in a frock coat, a mysterious type of frilly neckwear, and completely unfashionable eighteenth-century footwear. He handed Koni her hat carefully from behind.

"Or you can call me Koni. That probably makes more sense.

Koni's grin was as wide as the Cheshire Cat. She jerked a thumb at Jampheto behind her.

"And my consort here may be addressed as the Lord Goring. A magical fellow, rather out of place at the moment. Watteau would certainly have loved to paint him.

She mused.

"Or you can just call him Jamphe, like I do.

Jampheto grimaced good-naturedly. Aalana and Voight were dumbfounded. They had not expected a young Lady of the Court in about six inches of face paint. Nor a very dark six-foot-two islands-looking member of the aristocracy with sweat stains and makeup on frilly sleeves sticking out from under. Certainly not in Terminal Two. Aalana was confident these characters were not who they said they were.

At that moment, happily, Paul and See See rushed up behind Koni and Jampheto. They were coming from the car park. Aalana was glad to see they were sensibly dressed for the time and place. Both were as out of breath as Koni had been. Nevertheless, not quite matching her in scintillatingness. Paul was bemused. Koni all but bouncing. See See immediately without thinking put a hand on her twin sister's shoulder, as if to help hold her down. None of that was in the least new, costumes notwithstanding.

Introductions were done over. Identities corrected. Much remained to be explained. First, a flustering third-try rebooking. Then they trooped up and down the hall till they discovered the better of the two restaurants available and grabbed a table. Voight ordered a hamburger, despite doubts. Someone had told him in the English Midlands he was as like to receive meat on bread that tasted like horse.

"The thing is Mousy, you didn't say anything until I heard from Rees this afternoon. That was only about three p.m. A bit on the short side, eh? As you may know, I have a great many things!

Paul was smirking. It was a double bluff. He did have a great many things. And none were quite as important as all that.

"Nah, none of which are all that. The only important thing was keeping your big steel bars from coming down on our pretty little heads. A very Little Dutch Boy sort of work, if you ask me. Why do you keep calling her Mousy?

Neither Paul nor Aalana was asking Koni. And Aalana's eyes immediately began rolling, giving Paul a momentary advantage.

"Well, as you know, this is Aalana. Obviously, she goes by Lana. Lana is short, according to some, for Lanark. So, Lanark Town is near Dalzell on the River Clyde where it meets the Mouse Water. Therefore, our parents obviously intended her to be known as Mouse. And out of the love and affection due older siblings, I use the diminutive, Mousy. Simple! Makes perfect sense, right?

Koni was sure that it did. See See and Jamphe abstained. Voight seemed very interested in the concept. Aalana did not object, mainly because that was pointless.

"You will go to your grave saying that. And now I will go to my grave referring to you as the Little Dutch Boy.

Voight saw the opportunity to show some expertise on a subject he personally knew nothing about.

"Oh, I can see that. I see him there steadfastly holding together the Afsluitdijk with ten bare fingers. Spitting at the storm. All the Dutch are truly insane.

Koni wanted to know what an |Afsluitdijk| was. Luckily for Voight their food arrived. The hamburger was not in fact horse.

Over the next bunch of minutes, a few facts came out. As Aalana suspected, Koni and Jamphe were not actually Lady Cheveley and Lord Goring. Rather they were playing those parts in a production of |An Ideal Husband| put on by the Drama Club at Victoria University. They were coming straight from the dress rehearsal, not stopping even to de-robe. The props master would be furious. They weren't concerned.

Jampheto Maths was from Grand Turk. His parents, Etty and Buco, were Very Important People in the Turks and Caicos Islands. That is one of the better definitions of big fish, small pond. Everything remotely modern in the Turks and Caicos was new. Etty was in government. She had helped organize several functions from scratch, including fishing concessions, flags of convenience, and the insurance regulator. Buco ran several small businesses, as well as being a partner in ventures elsewhere in the Caribbean.

As a British territory, Turks and Caicos natives had similar secondary education options to See See and Koni. Not many of the very few people on Grand Turk had the financial resources to take advantage. Jampheto's family was better situated than most. He had matriculated at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, MIST, the year before.

Jamphe, as Koni insisted on calling him, was there for a degree in naval engineering with a minor in accounting. His goal was to translate his extremely practical knowledge of how to keep ships above water into something more formal. The family expected that would enable his dad's and cousins' boatyards across the Caribbean to take on larger work. It was a big investment and responsibility.

Secondarily, Jamphe's parents said he must take accounting in order to hold up the family name. Jamphe didn't know where his surname came from. He wasn't sure how serious his parents were about upholding it. He wasn't confused at all about the magnitude of the challenge his mom faced trying to manage the books for dozens of micro ventures. While highly practical, accounting wasn't the fun part of his studies.

The fun part of his studies was crossing the road to Victoria to join the Drama Bums productions. How does a giant wrench-wielding seaman with a non-magnetic compass and an accounting minor end up in the eighteenth century? He happens to sit one day at a table in the cafeteria near where Anakoni Athair held court.

It was essentially impossible to ignore any table or other geography Koni occupied. Koni left Jamphe wondering exactly how to engineer a meeting with her in much the same way Koni left See See wondering exactly how to adjust the laws of gravity to keep her beloved sibling's feet on the ground. It was a hard problem easily solved: he joined the play. Given how outlandishly poorly the part fit, it was perfect. He got attention.

The first go, Jampheto had a small part in a Noël Coward play he had no feeling for. However, it did loosen him up. And he was totally on board with Coward's idea that the English were obviously, definitely nuts. Oddly, he got a kick out of the makeup. He increasingly realized that made-up and costumed he could let loose in a way that Manchester hadn't encouraged him to under other circumstances. When the play was over the offer to join another in the new jury-rigged Royal Exchange Theatre seemed like a gas. She would be there. Jamphe was all in.

Paul also had a Koni problem, though not quite the same sort. His part in the play was to hold up the lights. The problem was to keep Koni and others safe in an environment that was more hazardous than expected. Karabiner Industries had sold Victoria and the University Theater a substantial new set of lighting trellises for the Tent, the converted exchange building now called the Royal Exchange Theatre. The sale was largely on the strength of the price-point and the after-sales support. The sale was less predicated on the actual tensile strength of anything. This was a problem. It was only a problem because Paul did what he would in the future never do, religiously: trust the customer to know what was in their best interest.

As it turned out, the Drama Department fops wanted no truck with the misty engineering geeks across the way. Clearly, they had their slide rules inside out, Paul thought. He was quite sure they had slide rules for careful calculations. Everyone did, right? The question was one of talent. His thought had been that people so well versed in lines-memorization would have no trouble with rote calculations, high school geometry, remembering tables of loading and weighing, and so forth. And it was in their interest to keep their fifty-pound lights from punching large holes through the stage into the traps.

The dramatists, even those of them that were mechanically minded, were not all that. Paul was chatting with, Holland Mercer, the theater manager the first day up in the improvised light booth. A scream and crash. Mick Corter hollering unnaturally hoarse at someone to grab a curtain. Doors slamming. Cloth ripping. Someone yelling for Holly. A walkie-talkie squawk squelched into a brief shriek. Running feet.

"Boss, it's Davy. Sodding winch rigging spit a bolt or something. Took him in the head. Gel frame scalped him like a bloody Viking. Mick's got him. Can I call an ambulance?

Paul wondered why he hadn't called one already.

The upshot of this was that Karabiner's Implementation Engineering Department, an entity that to that point had had no basis in fact or law, was prevailed upon to assess and remediate the cat's cradle of crazy gantry that had been erected to create the theater in-the-round's unusual rigging. The IED was suddenly a thing with employees. It had SKUs, contracts, and work rules. And it started directing traffic so that the gaffers, carpenters, and other stagehands didn't overload the batons and catwalks, burn down the curtains, or swing hot lights like deadly pendulums. It brought in good margin.

Better than that, it was how Paul renewed his acquaintance with See See. Koni had been running about on the day of the accident. See See had dropped by to see what she was up to. She had been sitting in the back doing annoying physical chemistry homework. A small corner of her mind kept track of Koni's bubbly voice. Then when the light bridge was raised and beginning to flash she looked up. She came down to the proscenium to watch. There she had a front-row experience of seeing a man almost flattened by a bar of lights tearing out of the ceiling. She ran to help stanch the bleeding.

Long story short, eventually, after things calmed down, Paul found himself staring at See See point-blank. He finally remembered where he had last had the pleasure at about the same time that she did. This was the boy from the terrifying family again.

With the setup Phaeton had given Paul, See See was fated to end up across the street having coffee with the exact young man her mom had said she shouldn't have anything to do with. It was predictable. In the middle of the conversation, it occurred to the same observant corner of her mind that her mom knew that was the way the universe worked. Given that, what did Cori really mean by it? See See wasn't sure she cared all that much.

It was a good story. Paul and See See told it less well than how amusingly Koni injected her and Jamphe's side of it. And it was not fully matchable by Aalana and Voight on their own, even though they were the toast of the evening. That was the nature of Koni and all she touched. Aalana was secretly grateful. It was way easier than shouldering the conversation would have been after a long trying day. And she was smiling again. Aalana had found a friend under the rainbow of Koni's carnival-helping of enthusiastic bubbles.

Later in the car on the way back to Manchester, Koni snapped a fake diamond brooch, a prop from the play, on Jamphe's wrist, echoing the storyline. She joked that she had him forever. In the driver's seat, Paul laughed and pulled out a cracked and oily o-ring washer and offered it to See See. He played off Koni's mock seriousness as he asked See See to be his lawfully wedded wife. Everyone laughed. Despite that, nobody was unserious. And everybody knew everyone knew it.

See See's eyes sparkled. She thought of the project her mother, Zolacurée Ashlar, was helping her craft. She didn't see any reason to tell Paul about it before it was ready for his finger. Created by Cori and See See, it was a bit cleverer than a washer. Had she thought of it, she might have guessed her mom might be assisting with another similar such project. She'd think of that later. Twins. Takes one to know one.

That had been a very good night.

"
Paul and See See next saw Aalana and Voight months later in Massachusetts after the latter returned from an abrupt elopement. By then Paul and See See had news of their own new family. The four of them walked along Memorial Drive in the evening. The sun low behind Harvard. Light reflecting off the Hancock Tower into the water. A quiet moment.

Aalana looked at Paul. They shared an unspoken thought: we made it out of Motherwell. Next, the world.

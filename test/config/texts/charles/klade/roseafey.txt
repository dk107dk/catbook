>1969 - Klade debriefs Roseafey in Motherwell

Roseafey knew what good teeth did to knuckles. It was one of many things she knew that she knew others didn't know. She also knew that she was overpaid. She knew that she was closer to her employer than others were. Which she knew wasn't saying much. She knew that if she broke that unacknowledged bond, however strong or weak, her teeth would have their turn. She also knew her teeth were sharper.

Klade watched Roseafey through the curve of a Waterford scotch glass. She flushed and faded with the drink. She curved, shrank, and grew with the glass. The hand that held the glass had had its knuckles bloodied. He didn’t mention it. He hadn’t picked up that she had already noticed. He paid Roseafey to notice things. Klade hadn't fully appreciated the degree to which she was already fully self-motivated in that regard.

Klade knew he thought about Roseafey more than he would like to. He knew he should step back. Introduce some edge. He knew there would be a time that called for it. He didn't know why he hesitated. It was bad to have a favorite operative. Pets were not Klade's thing. Even at thirty-two, he was still learning what his thing was. It was not docile. It was not predictable. Roseafey was neither.

When he was less than Roseafey's age his guardian's employer had taken an interest in the ill-fed lad that wouldn't stay down. He sent him to a severely competent man. The man had shown a hesitant young Klade a way of being that was intentional. Klade's life became a walk along a shade-tree street on a clear hot day. Light to shade. Shade to light. Advantages to each.

Klade had not been picked to be an organization face. Nor did he then imagine that role. He was groomed to be a knuckle-splitting fixer in the backstreet of heavy industry. A little shadow was useful. Hesitancy was not. Even decades later he still worried that he didn't move decisively enough. His internal monologue was brutal.

After a few growth years, the man sent Klade to the coalface. Ireland. In particular, the part of Ireland that was all political discontent, underemployment, and rough business. There he grew up a second time, and in a hurry. Insult and injury, served and sustained. He gritted his teeth and did the things he had been sent to do. Those things, he remembered.

In a poor area outside Dublin there were refugees. Roseafey was a daughter abandoned. Of mixed ancestry, she had grown up on an unlikely conveyor belt stretching from Dublin to Anatolia and back. Her life had been the alleys of Ireland, the Kurdistan mountains, refugee trails, fighting, running. Hushed meetings behind windows painted black. Sneaking across borders hungry at night.

Klade, then less experienced in recognizing talent, simply recognized something in Roseafey that he feared he didn't sufficiently find in himself. Recognized it and moved efficiently to attach it. So then, a change quite sudden: Roseafey, back in Dublin, took an unexpected job requiring unfamiliar things. New shoes and a modern hairstyle. A brief burnish at a school not entirely unlike one she'd burned down. A boat to somewhere new. Learning to cuss the English like the best Scottish do.

It was coarse sandpaper, efficiently applied to an alluring substrate wrapped around an unyielding core. Her edges were smoothed just enough. She'd learned to pass for a rootless northern European. A hip educated youth of ambiguous origins, limited prospects, and few resources. Dreaming of California. Drinking coffee from a |cezve|. The perfect sketch for observation, quiet action, and disappearing.

Roseafey spoke Kurmanji, passible Turkish, English with an Irish lilt, and devastating, if limited, barroom Gaelic. After seven years working for an outfit she made a noticeable point of not knowing anything about, her Scottish accent was workable. She didn't ask Klade questions. She grew sullen and sniped incomprehensibly if he tried to have her handled by others. She made herself understood.

At that moment, she was refraining from communicating that she wouldn't mind a glass. With Klade it would be seen as a weakness. She also held her tongue about her state of mind. Weeks stretched into months in Cumbria. It was too much. She didn't need Klade to know she had been losing it. To the point she had been considering the pub. Breaking bones in a bar brawl would have been a welcome release. No, of course not her beautiful bones. But someone's.

A brawl would also have drawn attention and left marks. Her job was to be invisible. For the rolling fells, no one better. She yearned for Hasköy and Hasankeyf. The rough hills and fertile lowlands of Batman on the Tigris. So unalike. Yet such good training for the fells above Sadgill. For the lights of Kendal and Skelsmergh, not so much. What a soft people. Even compared only to the Clydeside. A stupifying land of placid children. And not a man she cared to look at, much less shoot darts with.

Klade offered Roseafey a drink. Politely demurred. Legs crossed. Face held in an intentionally soft expression. They got down to it. She had seen essentially nothing. But not quite nothing. The patterns were for the most part consistent. The deviations, predictable.

She had entered the factory office one night. Near as she could make out, a healthy business with reasonable profits, reasonable growth, nothing questionable. She was no accountant, but it felt on the up and up.

Some names in the Rolodex were indeed unusual. No, she couldn't have said what it meant. There were many military titles. Many scientists. Many strange ports of call. Equally many fancy-sounding resorts in Norway. It seemed a curious business.

She had stolen a carton of mint cakes. It had been the best part of a long slog. She didn't tell Klade that part. Klade didn't point out that Charles's military and scientific history, in combination with the family’s sweet product, made such contacts unexceptional. He couldn't read if she'd picked that up herself.

The grandfather, Charles, had walked the fells early most days. She had followed. She had seen him working in the fields. She'd seen him fixing the water pumps and telephone wires. She'd seen the woman, Lottie, tending pigs and sheep. She'd checked the odometers of the pickups. Knew the habits of the struggling artist haunting the cottage. One time she briefly entered the house. The dogs were a problem.

The barn, on the other hand, was interesting. There was a lower story. It opened as four bays at the back. In front of the bays, thick slate walls. It was dug into a rise so that the front was fully below ground. They locked it tight as a drum. There were no windows. The below-ground rooms looked to be about forty-five feet wide by probably about twenty-foot, front wall to back. She could not get in. The doors were solid. Their burly antiquated hardware backed up by expensive modern security. This in a mild land of unlocked doors. She had become curious.

Her curiosity was sharpened by the deliveries. The factory often took in goods. Consumables were a constant flow. Also not infrequently, crates of equipment of various types. On the surface it was completely unsurprising for a busy, going concern.

However, she began to notice that the panel van picked up quite a few unknown articles from the train station and a local freight forwarder. It backed up to the garage, impossible to see. A significant fraction of the equipment crates and indeterminable packages seemed to be removed late in the day. Trucked to the farm by Aalunae, Charles, or, increasingly in late summer, by the Tanine kid.

The boxes went into the pickups under tarps. They went up the Longsleddale. They found their way quickly into the barn through the back. And that was it. They vanished, as far as Roseafey could know. Could she say what the boxes contained? She could not. Markings had been covered or removed. The wood and packaging never seemed to leave the premises.

Klade wanted to know who she had followed and how closely. Roseafey sensed an edge. Why? She had been instructed to follow the boy. Secondarily, the grandfather. This she had done.

She observed no correlations for the first few weeks. Gradually the activities of the kid and his granddad had become more closely aligned. Fell walks on weekends. Fieldwork, wall mending, trips to buy food, hardware, supplies for the farm. And then one day they had broken all their rhythms. Aalunae had left early. Paul had not. She watched the boy and Charles meet in the barn on what should have been a village day. They came out together, threw packs in the back of the green pickup, and drove up dale.

She had followed from the east, above the River Sprint. She got position west of Tarn Crag, above the dale east. Man and boy had hiked up Steel Rigg. They had then doubled back. Up high retracing the route of the pickup. Why the circle when a straight line would have done?

Roseafey followed as they doubled back past her perch three-quarters of a mile away on the other ridge. Then they spent hours in a cleft in the knott. High above the valley and about a hundred feet below the rolling top. She had her sniper's scope. She saw them hammering at a rock face. Taking turns. She was beyond curious. On the other hand, as bored as she had been, she knew she was grasping. And yet, it was odd.

When they had finally returned, they did it by a circuitous path that was unnecessary. Both had been spending a fair amount of their time on the fells. They had no need to go walking about on that particular day, that she knew of. They spent hours in one specific nook. Doing what? Then they took a tourist's jaunt, as if for appearance’s sake. And on arriving back at the farm, they had reentered the mysterious barn undercroft. They were down there several hours more.

Had she checked out the spot herself? Yes, as best she could tell she had cased it completely. There was nothing obvious. Which made it even a bit more strange.

After that day, the patterns were noticeably changed. Man and boy spent more and more time in the barn, together. Roseafey had broken her skinning knife's tip on the barn's subterranean vault's heavy door hardware. Klade would receive a bill. She didn’t know if she would have been able to gain entry with more time or tools. Perhaps. To have had another try she would have had to handle the dogs. As long as they were running about there were limited opportunities.

Klade made an appreciative gesture. He again offered a drink he knew would be refused. He complimented her tradecraft. She kept a carefully straight face as she let him know it was nothing. She was happy to have the work. They were silent. He wanted more. She wanted to get out. To go somewhere she could do something abrupt, careless, and unguarded. Anything.

He wanted in that barn. Klade didn't know if there was anything in it. Everything he'd learned so far expressed clearly that there was. And it involved the boy. For that reason alone he had to know.
And yet, beyond that imperative, there was something else. It felt to be something outside the ken of the Tanine universe. That something in that barn had value to someone. Several someones. It had caused ripples of silence, intentionally blank looks, and locked doors. It might well be that the answers were all in that locked barn crypt.

Locks be damned! Klade was bloody well going in. It only remained to decide exactly when and exactly how. It had to be done unobtrusively. There was ground to prepare. He needed more information. It was going to be a long project.

>1989 - Klade makes an admission at Dalzell House

Mackintosh Ioan Tanine's office wasn't opulent. It was neither large nor small. Well furnished. Materials solidly assembled. Teak paneling. High molded ceiling. Wide darkened oak flooring with cherry and maple accents formed in patterns adverse to a covering carpet. Two many-light mullioned ogee arch windows. There were lamps. There were books.

Half the office, nearest the door, was a quad formed by a set of bronze-riveted leather club chairs, centered by an ordinate coffee table, open to the large fireplace. The executive's desk occupied the other side. A modest alter to industrial power. The comfortable chairs were where business was actually conducted. Klade and Mac faced each other. The fire was low. Drinks untended before them.

These men were comfortable with each other. They were not the talkative sort. Mac's broad bluntly handsome face looked placidly out at the world as if waiting. It was a face that made it clear it could take physical abuse, if needs be, secure in the knowledge that his large body wouldn't be called on to retaliate. He had people for delivering kickings. They did it even more skillfully than he could. Klade was chief among those people.

Klade was the wolf to Mac's Kodiak bear. The apex predator that was to some eyes beautiful to look at. To some eyes, a bit more thinkable to confront. And which would, with refined precision, rip your face off. As befits a wolf, Klade was dressed in an impeccably tailored shirt, suspenders, highlands wool. Not quite what most would wear in the boardroom. Klade was not most people and didn't pretend otherwise. Neither was he in a boardroom.

"
Mac remembered the first time he met his right-hand man. He remembered it the way he chose to. Then, Mac had been caught unawares at a work action on the north side of Glasgow. It was at a mid-sized shipyard attached to an engineering works. Docks with stevedores and welders. Ironmongers and midshipmen. Metal benders, drop forge jacks, and rivet pullers. The men had been pressuring each other to unionize. Management was under pressure from declining sales and rampant regulations. A warehouse had burned. Jaws had been broken.

Klade was not thought to be management. Yet he supervised the yard. And he supervised security. Security men were relatively thick on the grounds that day. Mac was at the headquarters building for a board meeting. Other shareholders, likewise. The restive yard was quiet that morning. Klade's men, highly visible. All had seemed under control. The large cars of the directors took up substantial ground that the men carefully worked around.

In the glass, brick, and iron fourth-floor boardroom fifteen men considered the future of the recessing high-gross deadweight tonnage shipbuilding market, as against the burgeoning advanced engineered materials sectors. Motions were made. The fate of hundreds of jobs in the balance. Coffee drained. At first hot then cold. The arguments heated up and pens were thrown down. The men ultimately voted to throw the yard and works into a confusion of retrenched finances and redirected investment. Children would soon go hungry. Winter was coming.

Outside in the gray, the large cars started quietly. Mac pulled away first, as befits the Chairman who arrives last and leaves first. His chauffeur pulled slowly towards a rapidly growing rabble of heavy-duty men. Some carried heavy objects. All were as dirty as the dockyard. The car slowed. Its driver cowed. Mac, impatient. His secretary, nervous. The blocking men were angry. There were a lot of them. Where was security now?

Klade's men were not many, relative to the workers. They had pulled back to the headquarters building, in light of the important capitalists assembled. Now they were themselves rapidly assembling in a phalanx that attempted to act as the cow-catcher of the cars attempting the gates. The crowd was large. Some men at the back were on each other's shoulders. There was a strong smell of riot. A large man waving a heavy tamping bar over his head was hollering red-faced at the knot of security men and behind them Mac's leading saloon. He spit. Something hard hit the roof of the car.

At that point, Klade, then unknown to Mac, marched out to meet the rabble-rousing worker. He was two inches shorter, though he was not small. Mac smiled grimly behind the glass. This was becoming interesting. It seemed there might be blood, not just nicked paint.

Chest to chest, the air shook. The worker cuffed the brim of Klade's hat, knocking it from his head. Klade pushed him in the shoulder threateningly. Both on the balls of their feet. The men behind each stayed back to see their champions through. That the two men on the mat were mismatched was to everyone's satisfaction. Neither side quite believed, yet, that real, lasting damage would be done that day.

The unheard words and forceful gestures came to a head. Mac watched as the giant threw his iron one-handed to the ground with a force that made it rebound dangerously at the security men. Klade turned half away and unbuttoned his collar. Rolled up his sleeves. The worker, likewise.

They turned square. Slightly crouched. Slightly forward. Fists balled. The giant swinging his arms low like massive blacksmith's hammers. Klade's arms higher, outboard, aimed. The giant took a lazy first swing. Klade sidestepped easily. They were taking measures.

The giant, impatient, suddenly stepped in swinging with a right that could stop an illegal boxing match. Klade was enough faster. His head whipped to the side. Right leg swinging like a tripod. Left arm an upright, deflecting the flying flesh and bone bar stock that was attempting to find his face. In that way, stepping and forcing space for his right arm to fly up and back. He pulled a heavy sharp-ended iron rod from his back that had been strapped under his suspenders.

Pushing with his left leg and used the weight of the bar to recenter and twirl like a formal dance partner of deadly force. The bar collided with the giant's head stunning him. Klade then in beautifully choreographed steps slammed the bar end-in on the giant's windpipe. With his weight now on his right leg, Klade kicked his opponent's right leg at the knee, taking the dazed man down neatly. Next, the iron bar shattered his jaw. Then it smashed his nose inverted. There was blood. A lot of it.

At the same moment their opponents' champion was downed, three of the security men at the back, nearest the cars, whipped sawed-off shotguns from behind them and fired just over the workers' heads. The shocking close-in blast was the exclamation point on a deadpan declarative sentence written with an iron pen that said people would shortly die. It was neatly done. The crowd dispersed before the second shots, point-blank, had time to rip them with rock salt. Who knew eyes would have been lost, not lives? Klade. Pretty much just Klade.

Meanwhile, he was still busy. Klade delivered one final blow to the head that put the proletarian hero in a coma. He would exit from it only several weeks later, a changed man. As crumpled as a disrespected union's worthless agreement with management. Klade had managed to bloody his knuckles and muss his hair.

The following week Klade was working for Mac. He had moved south of Glasgow, donating his exceedingly spartan belongings to charity. Rees had had stressful days quickly arranging lodging and other particulars. Mac's secretary addressed the controversy of the face-off at the shipyard. Concerns were dismissed.

Tanine Holdings accommodatingly reorganized its roles. Mac made room for Klade near the top of the ladder. A height that made the top a stretch, but not a reach too far. Klade had efficiently risen to the challenge in a way that made heads spin. Reaching number three, he found it not entirely to his liking. He decided he was quite comfortable as number two.

It had been many years since. Long before, essentially all concerned had stopped asking questions about the man and his murky origins. Instead they had started reacting rather quickly to his requests. Aalasha was not in that circle. And Rees by virtue of his direct ties to both Mac and Aalasha also had some distance. Everyone else across the broad Clydeside looked sharpish.

Mac looked at his former protégée, now his near equal. He had grown older well. He had grown rich with grace and satisfaction. He was still unquestionably Mac's man. And he still craved the influence and power he wielded in Mac's employ.

Klade's impulses, needs, and actions echoed the generations. He was no different than the many captains of dragoons irregular of the houses Hamilton, Dalzell, and Tanine that came before. Likewise the heavies of Glasgow's tobacco lords, shipping magnates, and coal barons. Klade enthusiastically applied Scottish brute force to the bare backs of the River Clyde and the World. Mac continued to approve of what he saw in Klade. Klade no longer looked to see if he did.

"
"You said we needed to talk. What's on your mind?

Klade had set this up well. He did not mince words with Mac. Nor did he waste his own time.

"We need to talk about your late mother-in-law’s unfortunate fate. We have exposure. And we may have an opportunity.

Mac wanted the history, complete. And he was interested in an opportunity, always. Mac did not concern himself with human consequences. He was not born to it. And he had not put any effort into making up the deficit, other than to cover himself with charming when that was useful. There was only advantage and disadvantage, the ledger of life and the bank of time. Bollocks to all else.

Klade explained how he had come into knowledge of the Burns' generations of interweaving with the Chesterians. He told of the many threads he had pulled. Knots he loosened slowly. Assumptions, confirmations, the intrigue, and the intriguing.

Klade explained that he had likely identified an unknown object with secrets that would rock industry, if it could be obtained and explicated. He admitted there was much still unknown. He injected hints of the more bizarre question of Charles's refusal to grow old and die. He made clear what he felt was at stake: the power to upset the balance in any number of contexts. He indicated the possibilities might well be prodigal.

And in elaborating that story, Klade recharacterized the Chesterians in a way Mac had not considered. He did so so subtly, so elliptically. Merely in passing, he wove in an episode Mac may have missed. Klade offered it as both as useful information, but also, obviously, it was a potential buffer to himself. The Chesterians were dangerous. They had killed. In Mac's own house. Was he not aware of the facts of the untimely end of Jonsy?

Both men had long concluded that murder was best dealt with as a fact of life. Klade skated over his involvement in Aalunae's death, while not disavowing it. And he skated over the implication of Mac's to-be-assumed complicity in Aalasha's strike against their servant. It was left appropriately unstated. It didn't need to be.

Mac did not take it as a threat. He knew Klade's mind. He had himself shaped it. Were he Klade, he would to himself have done quite the same. To not so imply the apparent stricture the world would apply would be to appear to be unaware of the way the world worked. That would have done more damage. Not so much the facts as presented in the way that they were.

"Fine then. We must have this thing. What action do you recommend?

Klade's mouth turned upward in a swaggering snarl. His eyes narrowed dangerously. The face of a wolf ready to rip into its dinner.

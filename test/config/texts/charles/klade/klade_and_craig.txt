With characteristic upper-class presumption, Klade took the head of the Burns dining table. The shades were half drawn. The house was quiet. Out the back, Mrs. Burns was doing laundry. Pa was working at the fabrication shop. In the front room, Klade looked at Craig. Craig looked at Klade in the honor seat, in his house, all brushed wool and triple-stitched oiled leather. He leaned back and tried to remember that he was on his own turf.

Klade's half-moon lenses were gently smoked amber. He took them off. Laid them on a thin brad pin-bound sheaf. He carefully extracted a heavy pen from his attaché. Set it beside the papers. Leaned back. Straightened his cuffs. Looked up at Craig. Smiled in a way that was no doubt modeled on warmly.

"Thank you for seeing me Mister Burns. Craig. I'm glad to make your acquaintance. Your family has a beautiful residence.

Craig was not eager to hear Klade's commentary on the relative merits of their living arrangements. This posh fellow was unknown to him. He had gotten a call from the Works the evening before. His supervisor's supervisor told him he needed to welcome Klade's visit. Cryptically, he said Craig could talk with his union rep afterward, in a way that made it clear that doing so beforehand would be unwise.

On the day of the accident Craig had been briefly in the infirmary. Then he clocked out and hunted down his union rep. After a quick conversation, they saw the supervisor. Not long after Craig was heading home with the rest of the week off. Klade's visit came about forty-eight hours later.

"You're very welcome. Is there something I can help you with Mister Huxley?

Craig spoke stiffly, though he didn't mean to.

"Call me Klade, please. As you know, I work for your employer. In fact, I work for your father and your grandfather's employers as well. We know your family well. It's good to meet the next generation.

Craig was not completely familiar with his forebear’s CVs, and even less the Tanine Holdings family tree. However, he didn't look puzzled because it was pretty clear what was going on. This man was the company.

"How well do you know the boy who took a brand for you yesterday?

Craig didn't know him at all. Just his first name. Klade continued.

"Young Paul is a fighter. He's a lad, but he knows what's what and what's right. It was good he was there for you.

Craig still didn't know where this was going.

"Is he alright? I saw him at the infirmary. He looked bashed but Ok enough. How's he doing, then?

Klade was beginning to relax. This Burns chap had no idea.

"Paul is fine. He's a tough one. More than he looks. Paul takes after his father.

Klade stopped. Not on-the-noise pointedly. Nevertheless.

"That's good to hear. Who is Paul's father?

Craig was feeling like they were getting to the crux. He wasn't wrong.

"The boy is Paul Tanine. His father, Mackintosh Ioan Tanine, owns Dalzell Works.

Klade just let that beat drop. Meanwhile, Craig's face had changed. His eyes were open.

"Paul is a Tanine? No way! I don't believe it!

Klade was a connoisseur of people's reactions to Tanine. Craig's was naive. Yet, something more, maybe?

"Yes, indeed. Paul's father is, ultimately, your employer. That must be unexpected news.

Craig had a kind of inner look on his face that had Klade wondering.

"That was Paul Tanine?

"Yes. You look shocked.

Craig was.

"I wish I'd ha known. I would have told him who I was.

Klade was not expecting this. He was pulled up short. People didn't tend to inform Tanines of their identities, as if that were important information. Not typically. This was new.

"You speak like he would have known you. Is there a connection?

Klade had too much poise to show anything by the question.

"Surely, I was named after his... I guess his grandfather. And my father too. In a way, as such. My Da's Christian name is Kendal. My middle name is Chester.

To Klade, Craig looked eager, young, and unfiltered. He was puzzled and intrigued. There was something odd there. In Klade's experience, if he dug just a bit he would often find something of value. He poured his expression in a mold cast to look like mild doubt alloyed with the potential for disapprobation.

"That's quite a claim son. Break it down for me. Kendal and Chester are common English place names. Why do you say you were named after the Tanines?

Craig knew his job was to not look defensive. He was eager to do it.

"Well, that's what Da and Granda said. The way I heard it, Granda named my dad for Charlie's Kendal Mint Cakes. Later Da met Charlie himself. And much later, when I showed up they named me after Charlie. Chester is for Chesterian. Anyway, that's the story they tell. I'd never met Charlie, Paul or Paul's dad, though.

Craig caught a breath.

"Interesting. How did your grandfather come to know Charles Chesterian?

Craig was relieved that Klade seemed to be taking the story as fact. He was apparently not bothered by it. Craig didn't feel completely at ease. The whole conversation was unexpected, and its unexpected directions odd.

"I don't recall the details, sir. There was some kind of consultation. Charlie was an explorer. I guess he needed some special equipment. I guess my folks helped him get what he needed. This was all before I was born.

Klade felt it. This was real. While murky, it certainly had potential to be of use someday, somehow. He was glad he made this call himself. At the same time, he had a more basic task to complete. Presumably, Craig's perceived connection to the Tanines would make the next part easier.

"Well, Craig, what a story! And what a coincidence, yes? You were named for the forebears of the one who saved you from the fire. And you’d never met? Indeed, what a story!

Craig flushed. He realized his story must sound grasping. That he was believed was gratifying.

"Now you understand why I'm here. Young Paul did a brave thing. You can help his selfless spirit come to imbibe Dalzell Works.

Craig focused. How could he help?

"The family is proud of the boy. They feel his actions show the Scottish spirit. The Tanines are true Scotsmen. They bleed whisky and nippy broon. Their works are the pride of the nation. And the care they have for the workers should inspire the World. You can bear witness.

The invitation-weight pages on the table were a modest restatement of the account of the incident given by Craig, Paul, and others. The papers said Craig had indicated that the line horn had been loud, clear, and heard. They assured the reader that the line operated in all aspects as expected. They vouched that the hot roll mills were all in fine condition. The papers insisted that Craig's clothing getting caught in a machine was an unfortunate problem that an improvement to dress expectations and worker training could easily remedy.

For his part in the story, Craig would be given a plum promotion to one of the smaller high-end engineering firms nestled along the river. Much the same kind of R&D shop his grandfather worked in when he first met Charles. No more of the innumerable dangers in the dim vastness of Dalzell Works. A life-track of prospects. It was a good offer.

Craig, already indebted to Paul, was happy to oblige. He was not blind to what the company was doing: whitewashing shoddy maintenance and poor worker safety while glorifying the family scion and shutting down union complaints. While not blind, he was not too jaundiced to just be grateful for his life and the new opportunity. Neither too proud. And in return, he gave the company exactly what it wanted. No questions asked.

From there, the conversation was quickly concluded, perfectly to Klade's satisfaction.

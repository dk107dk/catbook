>1988 - Klade occupies Dalzell House

Klade had long since occupied an upper suite of several rooms on the north courtyard. He also had a small office closer to Mac's for times when they worked jointly. His personal rooms were far enough away to give each man plenty of space. Let there be no mistake, Klade was by no means a personal assistant. Nor was he a kept man.

As the acknowledged second executive of Tanine Holdings, Klade required a secure, central location. Massively underpopulated, yet grandly furnished, Dalzell House offered Klade his choice from several executive-caliber suites. The staff catered to his needs. He did not engage with Rees or Aalasha more than was absolutely necessary. When it was, his precise politeness conveyed much. A car stood by.

Klade's independence was a matter of sanctity. By that point, he had his own sizable staff and sat on several boards of directors across the Tanine Holdings. He reported to Mac on matters at the level of numbers and at the level of names. Nothing in between. They spoke of no dates, materials, projects, partnerships, or deals. Value grew or it did not. Individuals were curtailed or given reign. When Mac wanted to dig into one of those in-betweens, Klade took note. He assigned one of his senior people to work directly with Mac to make whatever needed to happen, happen.

At seven a.m. Mac and Klade had a working continental breakfast. By then, both would have been up for hours. Klade boxed in the House's gym. He had had it installed in the subbasement. It required substantial ventilation, plumbing, and electrical work. Situated so low down within two- to four-foot-thick walls, he had complete privacy to vent aggression and sweat. After breakfast, the phone. The afternoons were often on-site for various meetings and interdictions.

By eight p.m. Klade was in his rooms. He avoided dinners where practical. If not avoidable, he invariably was first to leave. Klade's time was coveted by all; therefore, its proper use was respected by all. Galas, awards ceremonies, celebratory dinners, and the like generally proceeded just fine without his attendance. If his attendance seemed important, it was possible that the better answer was for Mac himself to attend.

Klade had never been short of pet projects. Some he worked on strictly alone. Some cooked slowly for many years. The Chesterian Problem had been one of those. First, he merest hint. The boy, Paul, saved a life. The life saved turned out to be a dangling thread. He pulled on the thread and quickly found more than he had expected. Yet early on at least, hardly a burning bush.

He enlisted hired detectives to gather the basic facts. As the facts didn't dissuade him, and as the scene of action drifted south, he upgraded to a more unique talent with a greater range, in every sense. Roseafey. She was one of a small number of tools he could use in aggressive ways. Of the few, he felt she was his best. While challenging his naturally cool demeanor, she frequently delivered the unexpected upside.

Facts emerged. The young man Craig and his father were named after Aalasha's father. Cayton was almost thirty years in the grave. His son Kendal likewise, fewer years. Klade’s detectives learned that Cayton had gone soft at the end. They reported that Cayton had become fixated on fringe science, crypto-metallurgical theories, bordering on alchemy. Most of Mac's companies' employees died early, engaging the telly in monosyllabic expressions of pain, want, or acceptance. He had seen too much of it. It was depressing. Alchemy seemed decidedly preferable.

In a similar way, Kendal had followed his dad's atypical footsteps. There had been schooling in the family. No sin, yet not common in Motherwell. Without leaving the Tanine universe for long, Kendal's had been a peripatetic work life. He sought only the most advanced technologies. Not finding what he wanted, he kept looking. This built in him valuable expertise. Ultimately, however, he was not a great employee. Something worldly was missing.

Klade gave his supervisor of detectives, Arbery Carfrae, standing orders. Carfrae was a fieldwork leader with time in the states under Allan Pinkerton. The man led a modest squad of experienced operatives floating between Tanine Holding's handful of security interests. Under the day's circumstances of labor unrest, political uncertainty, and an economic tide running the wrong way, Arbery's personal attention and delicate touch complemented Roseafey's indelicate one.

Arbery had made inquiries. He heard unexpectedly vivid stories. Old stories that had clearly grown into outright tales. And yet, from several directions with much overlap, an image slowly emerged. The old arctic explorer brought something to Clydeside. That thing was superlatively invulnerable, quixotic, intangible, and what have you. Assuredly, he heard little enough. But it wasn't nothing. It all added to the small but growing pile of reports.

The boy, Paul, had thrown a fit shortly after Klade's interest had first been roused. His mum chivvied him off to Kirkby Kendal. More specifically, to Aalunae and Charles Chesterian's Fellfall Farm up the Longsleddale. A few weeks later, not knowing what to expect, he sent Roseafey on a hardship posting to the lush English countryside in summer. She hadn't looked happy about it. He hadn't felt at all bad. At least not at the time.

The upshot? There had been unexpected activity on the farm. Tight security, casually concealed. An increasingly tight bond between the old folks and the boy. His stay was held over. When he eventually returned to Dalzell House it had been time.

Roseafey returned south with heavy tools and instructions. Access was difficult. Fellfall was on guard. Yet Roseafey was good. She managed to steal a diary and some papers. Their contents was suggestive. They were, of course, missed and the reaction of the couple was swift: they locked down even tighter. They replaced the dogs poisoned with larger, meaner dogs.

Beyond all that, something else. Something subtle. He wasn't sure Roseafey picked up on it. Charles was old. Not ancient, surely. At least seventy-five. Arbery had thought possibly as high as seventy-seven. No rule of nature says a seventy-seven-year-old man can't be as active as a fifty-year-old man. It is unusual, though, and was noted as such. Wild conjecture hadn’t been warranted at that point in time. Then, Klade anticipated that the mystery would resolve in due time in Motherwell out of intestate, induced or otherwise.

That point in time had begun looking very different from the vantage of about fifteen years further down the road. Charles had not changed. The question was becoming more and more vexing. Something would have to be done about it. Klade wasn't sure what. The recent unfortunate events at Fellfall certainly complicated the question.

The diary Roseafey had pinched was much as you might expect from an explorer of the old school. It began crustily, abrupt, with a self-dismissive tone. Curt sentences that shed little light on why Charles started writing. As the pages multiplied years had passed. It had become a more fluid and thoughtful record of conversations, possible contacts, footnotes, drawings, and such. The record of someone unused to hard intellectual labor slowly unlimbering his mind.

It seems Charles had first chased down scientists with nonsensical questions. Then, a few years later, he apparently graduated from books, phone calls, and stalking researchers in their native habitats, to simply matriculating at Victoria Collage in Manchester as their oldest student, under the cover of being adjunct facility. He commuted between the City and Kendal. Aalunae often spent days with Charles down south, while the factory was seen to by younger managers.

Klade assumed that change in routine kept Charles out of the sight of villagers who must have been beginning to wonder how he kept so fit. What of Aalunae? Arbery had found inconclusive indications. A parish fire and various poor record-keeping practices on the part of the local authorities. Arbery had felt it was possible she was significantly younger. Unlikely anything could be verified.

Klade had personally followed up with some of the names in the diary. One of them had even been family. So to speak. Klade was estranged from the main branches of the Huxley tree. His grandfather had been the brother of Julian Huxley and Aldous Huxley. Noel Trevenen Huxley had committed suicide. How much that fact had to do with the pregnancy of Celene May Blacker was not known to Klade. The offspring was Scranton Huxley, Klade's father. Scranton went to his early death unfamiliar to his son. He had an even less close relationship to the more famous members of the family tree.

Charles had encountered Julian in his exploration of the sciences. Julian was a biologist with a knack for being right and even more of a knack for making people assume he would be. As a scientist, he was well-known. He was not a leading thinker of the day. Instead, his impressive contributions were in synthesis, structuring, and popularizing the large body of the theory and practice of evolutionary biology. As Charles astutely saw, Julian could point him to the best man in essentially any scientific discipline remotely related to biology.

Reluctantly, Klade had made a call. It was not much illuminating. An aged Julian remembered the interaction only very slightly. He thought that he had pointed Charles to Rosy Franklin. Charles's diary confirmed that he had met with Rosalind Franklin years later at King's Collage, London. That made Julian's lack of clarity on why he might have sent Charles to Rosy frustrating. The notebook speculated on x-ray crystallography, without giving any idea why that should be of interest. Klade, not knowing for x-ray crystallography, could only assume Charles was more after chemistry insights than biological ones.

This slow detective work, both his own, Roseafey's, and that of the actual detectives, consumed much time. Klade became more obsessed as the years wore on. Even so, his time for personal obsessions shrank. Societal and corporate demands were a withering fire.

It appeared Charles was patiently, bloody mindedly pursuing knowledge that was beyond the ken. He hammered on some object impenetrable to the xray eyes of prize-winning physical scientists with a persistence that was telling. It appeared Paul was deeply involved and perhaps being groomed to continue the indefatigability into generations.

By contrast, patience wasn't Klade's strongest suit. The Chesterians's ages were increasingly raising eyebrows, not least his. Paul's company, Karabiner, was increasingly underfoot, out competing Tanine companies in the world of speciality engineered materials. An amateur effort seemingly way out of its depth, and yet confoundingly, mysteriously not. And the many rumors and implications. From the many, Klade struggled to find the right thread to pull. And he struggled to allocate time to pulling. Instead, having to rely on observers. And, even with those, only very seldom applying direct action.

That had been the story of years. But that period was in the past. In a moment of wanting a distraction from his own swelling age and weaknesses, he had demanded Roseafey do more. That she obtain better information. Maybe even attach whatever object lay at the core of the familial morass.

Frustration with his impotence in the matter had caused him to swing a blunt force in an unthoughtful moment. What was he trying to prove to that bluntness? In hindsight, he had to admit, certainly something. As he had once feared, a favorite operator had become a fractured operation that proved only his fallibility. Fallibility was for sure not his thing.

So regardless, Roseafey had invaded Fellfall. This time with indiscretion. And with with resulting bad luck and trouble. Aalunae was dead. Roseafey, hurt, went into hiding. The object, whatever it might be, had been moved recently leaving behind security measures wide open. An unusual collection of tools seemingly abandoned.

That night Roseafey had gathered up more papers and journals. Klade looked at them grimly. Black and brown leather. Some banded, some buckled. Most about two hundred pages. He opened one. It contained Charles's increasingly precise script.

The contents was much as in the first volume pilfered years prior. Drawings with lines and notes. Footnotes and references. Except this time, in this diary, all was encoded. And not in just one system. There was cyphertext interspersed with unusual runes. There were paragraphs in lines of English that almost made trivial, contextual sense, and yet did not. There was Morris code that decoded to incomprehensible lists of numbers. Some looked like headings. Others like frequencies. Many more just looked to Klade like numbers.

It was a cornucopia of misdirection, opaque structure, context-free lists, and obfuscation. Clearly, these journals were all a part of the same investigation. Much of the writing was something new. The pace was accelerating, not growing old. Klade felt the new parts, coded or not, suggested action, not research. He could not, of course, be at all sure.

What he did know? At that point, several things. He was an accomplice to burglary and murder in the second degree. His quarry had begun protecting its information like there was something of immense value to hide. The trail had gone cold. The man stalked had gone to ground so effectively it was clearly not a one-person operation. The main target of his observation was about ninety-five years old and yet had been living in Manchester as an adjunct professor assumed to be in his forties or fifties. And Klade had no idea what to do next.

That was the state of affairs when Arbery brought Klade the word: Charles Chesterian was dead. Killed like a silly old fool hiking up Ben Nevis. Caught in the first snow of the season. The body had been cremated. Aalasha was again in seclusion, mourning a beloved parent. Klade didn't believe a word of it. He was in way too deep for a first brush-off to shake him.

Klade thought it was probably time to risk a frank conversation with Mac. How frank? More importantly, to achieve what? And above all else, how could he protect himself from the unforeseen? Mac was unpredictable. Unsurprisingly, Klade thought he had an ace in his hand.

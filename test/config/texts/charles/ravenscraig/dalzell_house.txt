>1950 - The fairytale of Dalzell House, Motherwell

The tower house at Motherwell stood on the banks of the River Clyde, originally built by the Dalzells some four hundred years prior. It stood mute with warm light reflecting off the windows. Velvet and lace curtains fluttered high above brute walls. Flush with a mossy patina. Under siege by well-clipped but rebellious weeds.

A brougham in black and gold loitered on the gravel forecourt. Alongside it, a blue and burgundy cabriolet. At-the-ready drivers reclined caps off on the running board. The cab screened them from the dark pile full of quiet upper-class indications visible behind the entrance arches cut through fortified walls. It was a picture by turns domesticated, imposing, and private.

In the hot summer of 1870, Dale Cartwright Tanine stood by his trap well back from the thick gates. Afternoon sun low behind him. He looked at a home. Even so, his subconscious perceived a defensible keep fit for protracted industrial warfare.

A distant oboe practicing awkwardly came quietly through the trees. Dale tugged his kid gloves unthinkingly. More intentionally cocked his top hat forward. He climbed up, turned the vehicle, mind made up finally after not a few visits. He resolved that his majordomo should arrange for the family's solicitor and land agents to negotiate a deal. The family took possession of Dalzell House the following summer. Repairs, moving in, and redecorating, another year.

Dale's youngest grandson, Mackintosh Ioan Tanine, would be born at Dalzell House fifty years later. Mac, son of Robert, heir to the Tanine iron, steel and manufactures empire surrounding Motherwell and various towns along the Clyde north to Glasgow, was the oldest of four. His sister, Clare Marian was three years his junior. Brothers Dale Laird and Robert Stuver both died as children, Dale in an accident on the grounds and Robert from polio.

Clare and Mac were inseparable up until Mac reached ten. At that time, Robert took charge of his son's education and upbringing with a military discipline, using handlers, manservants, tutors, and his business partners and managers as tools to sinter Mac into Tanine carbide steel. Mac, Clare, and their mother and nursemaids settled into distant orbits. Clare never forgave Robert for the mancipation of her playmate, piano accompanist, and protector. Her mother, Mary Ann, slowly withdrew from the world beyond the gates of Dalzell.

In 1950 Mac encountered Aalasha Chesterian, Charles Chesterian's daughter. They met glancingly in Aalasha's final year at university. Mac spied an object of beauty from afar. A tall, dark elegance as indelicate as Ordovician limestone. He made contrivances to get closer. Uncommonly for Mac, the prospective dalliance was distantly rebuffed.

Mac's blood was raised by the challenge Aalasha presented. Soon enough he identified a weakness and pressed his attack. His bodyman infiltrated Aalasha's circles, speaking of Mac, the knight in shining armor. Her department chair spoke of a prince of foreign highlands. Aalasha's thesis advisor encountered a lambent Scottish laird sallied forth from his northern castle. The ground prepared, Mac reenacted their meeting, this time in full eloquence and ardor. Playing the role she had envisioned for herself since childhood, the princess duly succumbed.

Within a year the couple were affianced. Mac and Robert used Mac and Aalasha's marriage ceremony as the foundation for a two-day diplomatic affair at Chatelherault Country Park. It was an exclusive series of parties and dinners, games and hunts, cocktails, cigars, and current events. Mac used the occasion to cement his very public accession to the head of the Tanine world.

Less exuberantly, Robert rallied the Clydeside Conservative Party. He strategically paired off his allies in industry with the policos in his pocket. Punchbowl and pheasant diplomacy led in time to new alliances. Those laid the groundwork for the denationalization of steel in County Lanark on terms favorable to Tanine companies and interests. Aalasha, new to the Tanineocracy and high society, was only half aware of her new husband's and father-in-law's machinations. She drank it all in.

After all the festivities wound down, Mac and Aalasha honeymooned in Malta. Theirs was the first residence of a Tanine in the family's villa in Valletta overlooking Marsamxett Harbor. The villa was cool and quiet. The world was not within its limestone vaults and silked galleries. Elegant moldings wanted care. Eggshell paint flaked evocatively. The floors percussively flexed. They murmured tales of a tired empire. Only a few of the many stately retreats were presently occupied by the withdrawing English elite.

Still, the beaches were so beautiful. Dinner on the harbor lit by mirrored paraffin lamps minutely swaying. Chamber music with beautiful new friends. While Mac and Aalasha soaked up the dry heat of August and September, Robert and Mary Ann decamped for a palatial townhouse in Glasgow. All too soon the newlyweds packed their linens and headed North. Back to the rushing Clyde and their first winter as the resplendent young master and lady of Dalzell House.

Not many months later, Charles and Aalunae Chesterian's grandchildren came in quick succession, though far from the simplicity of the Lake District fells. Aalana and Paul were seemingly a straightforward continuation of a modern industrial family in a stately home. For Aalasha, tightly wound in her own inner world, there was considerably more to it than that.

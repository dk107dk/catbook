>A loss

I never met Luna. My great great grandmother, Aalunae, died long ago. I didn't need to meet her to know her. Bora told me everything. How they met. How he came back to civilization for her. How his injured feet turned south-southeast before his mind even knew why he had to. How they lived. And he told me how she died.

I am not much affected by death. It is a thing I am able to feel sorry about, but I don't really feel it. Upbringings, am I right? We are what we are taught to be. I was not taught that.

Bora, my great great grandfather, Charles, told me that the overcast day he and Paul scattered a third of Luna's ashes from Shipman Knotts over Fellfall Farm for the first time in his life he felt lost. He had felt loss. Lost digits. Lost faith in deliverers. But it was different.

Imagine Bora's little finger on his unlucky hand. You can imagine how the phantom digit must have felt. After all, you yourself have such a digit as he had had.

But now – and you can try this at home – wrap your hand with a thick roll of cotton. Snugly around the fingers so that your pinky barely shows. As you do, run a splint up the metacarpal and the base of the little finger's proximal phalanx. Use a popsicle stick, or whatever. Make a big mitt of it and then wrap the wrist with tape. Sit your elbow firmly on the table, keep totally still, drink a tall glass of cold water, and let the blood drain away. Count up to, I don't know, a lot.

Soon enough, your pinky is all but gone. Without moving it, or touching the tip, where exactly is it? A phantom. A loss more lost than a man's capacity for hunger after twenty five days crawling through the Alaskan uplands eating little more than rancid hope. A void.

Now imagine you are that missing finger. And now you have an idea how Bora felt when his body was ripped away.

That, I am affected by.

I've seen the urn of the one third of Aalunae's ashes that Charles gave to Paul and the others of the third generation. I don't know what happened to Aalasha's third.

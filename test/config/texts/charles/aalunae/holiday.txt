1950 - Aalasha's last visit to Kendal

In the late summer before her last year reading botany at college, Aalasha and her mum sat at the large kitchen table of Low Fellside Way. Aalunae periodically tonguing her unnaturally sharpened canine. Aalasha subliminally perceiving it, and her calves flexing involuntarily when she did. The porridge had burnt that morning. It still hung in the air beneath the riot of field smells.

As every year, they wove mats of dried grasses. Amongst the strands, knots of sedge, sweet grass, and barley. Braille crossbred with organic engraving. Hieroglyphic Rorschach tapestries. Memories of childhood freedom and an unspoken yearning for rapprochement.

What they produced would wrap the back of the Fellsman's booth at the Westmorland County Show. Soft country colors setting off the striking blue wrapper of the main product: Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cake. Not even Charles knew the woven stories he stood silently before, year by year. Charles spoke little as he handed out sample wedges of local pride.

The County Show was no longer the most noticeable bump in annual sales. When Aalasha's parents were newlyweds Westmorland would sell in a week as many mint cakes as February, March, and April combined. Time and labor happened. The Fellsman booth still stood in a high traffic location. The logo still prominent. The family still subscribed to the Agricultural.

Throughout the lean 1940s the cartway business slowly grew. Expeditions of Hilary, Shackleton, and Perry. Expeditionary army rations and fraught SAS and SBS adventures. Small but growing exports to Norway. These connections were one of Charles's primary contributions to the business. That, along with kitchen sweat and shrewd practices that cut supply and distribution to less than half by unit cost. A unheralded miracle of village savvy by a man who explored commerce with the same grim determination as he displayed to nobody in the empty Seward Peninsula.

Aalasha was up from Manchester for a week. A long week, by some lights. She would help prepare. Then back to university, skipping the show. It was Charles's plea for her to come that she came at all. She had competing interests and she and Aalunae sometimes developed into a storm. Some choices are hard.

Fingers flew. Aalasha could tie knots faster. Aalunae was better at the weft. The table was more and more uncovered. It was like when she was ten. Up to a point. Charles dumped new material as the table could take it. Then disappeared again, hoping for the best.

As they worked, Aalasha rattled out an anodyne version of life down south. In words and not words. Questions as to the family and the business. In return, the press release story of a man surviving a mountain with Kendal Mint Cakes in his rucksack. Shrugs, tics, nods. Selvage loops, shed, sleying. A quickly growing scroll of strained and only sometimes audible enthusiasm.

In time, Aalasha loosened. Out came real stories for her mum. School, projects, a summer job. She avoided friendships, there were few, and beaus, potentially many. Aalunae had long observed Aalasha's magnetic effect on people, especially young men. Unlike Aalasha she had few blind spots.

Manchester was but seventy miles from the Kendal. A quick ride to the station. Three hours on the Club to Manchester. Bus or taxi to the apartment. Aalasha had lived off campus for the past two years. She liked the freedom. Close quarters were uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, Aalasha would return to close quarters. An au pair's flat on Wilmslow Road in Fallowsfield. Her first experience of joining a lease. The lettor, a surgeon. His wife, a nurse. Her flatmates, both graduate students. One interning at the Medical Library. The other working as a research assistant to a professor of economic history. So many people. Aalasha was apprehensive. Her new flatmates should have been more so.

Aalasha was coming off a year partly occupied by an internship for Victoria's Department of Botany. She had minimized her time in the dormitory by helping setup a horticultural research center at Jodrell Bank. As part of the work she had spent most weekends and a two and a half summer months on site in the mud. Living packed into a tiny student's flat with three strangers was new.

Aalasha's fingers flew through the strands. And yet, conversation lagged. Aalunae, probing for a topic, asked her daughter what the research station was like.

"A farm, not even a farm really. It is just a few barns and a small house for a lab and overnight rooms. We had a tent as well in July and August. I took the tent, of course! Wasn't like camping on the fells, but so much better than student housing. It smelled glorious after moldy books and chalk dust.

Aalunae agreed that it must have been a good summer. She had seen a Brownie shot of the cottage in May. It had not been attractive. Another snapshot from late August showed a trim structure. A tumble of materials. Fieldstone. Brick. Slate. Beige clapboard with slightly patinated screening tacked down to the porch in a copper veil. Yellow trim, blue doors. A little university money and some cheap student labor created a pretty field lab.

Aalasha got an animated look on her face, remembering.

"Mum, there were a bunch of physicists about. The fields beside the aggie were for astrophysics. Total space nutters. They were building telescopes and radio sets. We fed them. They let us look at the stars. Listen to the universe and the radio waves bouncing off atmospheric layers. I liked them.

Aalunae cocked an eye without looking up from her weaving.

What Aalasha didn't specifically relate was easy to guess: there had been a boy. Actually, there had probably been multiple boys, Aalunae thought. She was on the mark. Despite Aalunae's lack of first-hand experience, the call was easy. Everybody knew what university was supposed to be like.

One of the boys stood out. Phaeton Athair was a year younger and a head taller. An undergrad reading Astronomy. He had shown up in May as a department pack animal. Having arrived, he quickly graduated from pack animal to manual laborer. Phaeton built structures, assembled trellises and antennas, strung wire, and reshingled the roof of another run-down coop. He did the last badly, with cheap broken slate. Astronomers are not handy.

Phaeton was strong and serious. He looked good as he labored. It took Aalasha several days to catch his attention. Finally he posted a wire run across the aggie station fence where she was working. Serendipity! It was amusing to realize he was more comfortable with her in mud-caked up to her eyes than with her clean. She learned that that was of the nature of being an aspiring physicist. He learned about mud, plants, the breaking of nails, and organic eyeshadow. They enjoyed the conversation and found excuses to continue it.

Aalunae flashed questions to Aalasha. Where was he from? How had he joined the summer study group? Did she have time to be social with the other astronomers? Did the students eat and go out in groups together? What did the stars look like?

These were plainly leading questions. They pulled at Aalasha. They were annoying. She switched to plants.

Aalasha had been responsible for growing cryptogams and running mycological studies for her advisor, a noted expert in the field. Her knowledge of medicinal plants and entheogens had been useful. She had excelled. As the summer wore on she become the station's second in command and a tutor to students with more suburban or inner-city upbringings. The station's equipment was poor. She used it exceedingly well.

Aalunae noticed how Aalasha shifted her weight as she talked about the lab. Fingers never slowed. A shoulder drooped. Her ankles uncrossed aggressively. Why were her eyes drifting to her right arm? Aalasha liked to tell flamboyant stories. Aalunae's gifts were more to detective work.

What Aalasha elided in these matters was less obvious. And yet Aalunae was intuiting things easily enough. She suspected anger, loss, and jealousy. Possibly leading to a course of experimentation not directed by the instructor. Observations. Minute increments and formulations. Aalasha was teaching herself so much, so quickly. Perhaps recklessly? Regardless, formal education was but a socially acceptable pastime.

Aalasha didn't realize how well Aalunae could read her in so many ways. Her pose in the moment. Vocalization. Weaving. Juxtapositions and contradictions. All kinds of sensory interference. More and more of them as she became more animated. In the quiet at the back of Aalunae's mind, there was, too, a cypher.

Growing up, Aalasha had kept a coded diary rolled up and stuffed into a hollow bedpost. She used the same cypher on a stack of copperplate behind the poison garden shed. Aalasha had graved intaglio tracery of plant cuttings. Graphite, Sellotape, tracing paper, and sharp objects. Vinegar-scented verdigris-covered plates she bought for scrap in Coniston. They were surprisingly fine for one self-taught. Beautiful as art. To one skilled in the botanical arts, potentially troubling.

Aalunae, knowing plants, used the plates to crack the simple substitution encoding. From it she learned many things. She had been untroubled by the need to act upon what she learned. She felt such things would take care of themselves, in time. Like most people, Aalunae felt her behavior in all things was entirely consistent. Aalasha probably would not have agreed.

"
Phaeton had been an obsession of some weeks duration. The spell was broken by a Saturday trip to market. The Physics Department Fellow leading summer space camp was eager to do some one-on-one extra credit study with the Fellow proctoring the organics. The four bios and three astros were herded into a farm cart, aimed at town, and sent off.

By strategy, Aalasha scored the fireman's seat beside Phaeton. He, as the tallest and most sober-minded boy, found himself holding the reigns. Stiff-backed, he hunched his shoulders slightly. Phaeton could drive a cart. They moved forward. Phaeton looked intently through the ears and over the bridal. He barely turned his head Aalasha's direction and said little the whole twenty-minute ride. Was he avoiding her gaze? She thought so.

Almost as the wheels stopped Aalasha saw another girl tumble over the other side of the wagon and grab Phaeton's jacket to stop herself falling. It was neatly done. This was a henna-red Cora Pearl named Hannah Wesley. She was a bit older than Aalasha. More urbane charm, less country pluck. Hannah was clearly practiced in the physical art of romantic comedy. Aalasha had had her eye on her.

Phaeton caught Hannah before she could fall to the muddy grass. He didn't let go as quickly as Aalasha would have hoped for. And he obviously wasn't seeing Hannah for the first time. Aalasha kicked down on the running board. It groaned. She spent the day considering her options. She didn't find many easy ones. She was outclassed on the field of young men. Truth be told, so was Phaeton. As the day wore on, Aalasha grew annoyed.

Nevertheless, the summer continued largely in fine spirits. The wildflowers were pollen-drenched. Warm air from the North Atlantic Current pooled lazily over the fields. An unusually clear sky raised the students' average temperature well above the datum. Cocoons cleaved. Butterflies flew. Selfheal crept up the enclosures. Life slowed down to drink the moment.

The weather turned dry and the unpaved lanes leading to the aggie station and the telescopes became hard-packed. Then despite the crowd of budding scientists, a notable occurrence happened without observation. Aalasha Chesterian, Phaeton Athair, and Mackintosh Ioan Tanine found themselves in close proximity for the first time. Within hailing distance. If only briefly and without any deep realization. Had they seen into the near future, they probably would have closed the distance. Had they had insight into the long run, likely the opposite.

England is a small country. It has a few tens of millions of people. All of them jammed on a narrow spit of land sticking up from the wide Atlantic. Coincidence, co-evolution, and collimation are therefore all but inescapable.

Aalasha first saw Mac from two fields over. A tall, powerfully-dressed man unfolding himself out of a long black motorcar. Gesturing excitedly at the ramshackle radio towers to several men tumbling out of a following car. At the time, she thought nothing of it. Later she would remember. However, not the way the day actually happened.

Phaeton was more immediately engaged. Mac was there as both benefactor and supplier. The Tanines, steel barons, endowed chairs in Victoria's sciences departments. They also were suppliers of steel plate and beams. They would be happy to supply more of it.

Mac wanted to be a part of constructing the exorbitant vision of Phaeton's thesis advisor, employer, and, eventually, confidant, Bernard Lovell. A grand telescope of unheard-of dimensions. A telescope straight out of a Jetsons' future that would stare ten billion years into the past. If Mac could finesse a sizable tax benefit and a massive sale at the same time his father, Robert Tanine, would be proud. Meanwhile, Mac was having a ball playing Big Man On Campus, especially for attractive upperclassmen.

Phaeton was awed. While Mac was only a few years his senior, he was the confident eye of his own whirlwind. Robert's men effected Mac's directions. Mac was quickly evolving into someone men took orders from, sharpish. Robert or no.

Lovell's chief engineer, Husband, was staid and forceful in his own way. Mac and he talked past one another. Husband about wind sheer and torsion loading. Mac about material grades, precise milling, and cost-efficient construction. Phaeton arranged lunch and walked Mac through the grounds. The conversation was not scientific. He was once again out of his depth.

Aalasha preoccupied with the minute details of smaller things than Mac Tanine and his steel. The effects of the hot days on delicate samples. The coming end of her cryptogams and |physik| crops' growing season. Keeping a dwindling supply of science equipment and materials going. Maintaining the summer students' discipline as their thoughts increasingly turned to the fall semester in the city. On the biology station, Aalasha became the iron fist in the feminine flower-print gardening glove.

And too, her concerns ran to the longitudinal experiment she had been running on Hannah. This latter effort was her most immediate and absorbing. Day by day its course steadily became more impactful to the subject under inquiry. It was, as carefully recorded observations written crisply in a child's code described, devastating. In Aalasha's eyes, it was going swimmingly, indeed.

Aalasha left that last part out of her storytelling. Did Aalunae intuit it? Hard to say.

Aalunae enjoyed her daughter's stories. They laughed as they hadn't done in some time. And their fingers flew. The time they passed ate into the time until Mac would enter the same room and introduce himself to Aalunae modestly as the man seeking her blessing to take Aalasha away. An event that would later be memorialized in weaving. By Aalunae alone. Decidedly with an edge.

Years later, Aalasha's grandson, Ari Tanine, would find, preserve, and stretch the fibers of that woven story on a pine frame. I saw it decorate a wall looking over the Atlantic three thousand miles west. A fitting piece for a rustic artists' colony with many stories to tell. He would display it there principally to remind himself not to trust people quickly or speak too freely.

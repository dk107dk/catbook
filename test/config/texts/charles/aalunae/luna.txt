The snow globe's grains clung to the deepening sky, ready to plunge. Aalunae felt topsy-turvy all afternoon. Now the world clung to her feet and she dangled over the universe, spinning. Giddy with sing-song, laughs, looks, and tawny owl calls.

"...Who calls?
"  Who who?
"Know you?
"  Know who?
"She flew
"  Call me
"Goodeehoo
"  Who Me?
"Goodeehoo...

The land and sky. The quiet wind and silent lives. Aalunae had spent her brief intense childhood looking down and making things. Now, riding up the heath to the bare crags with this man, Charles, she looked up and out. The horizon was so far. The sky was so high.

They had set out light. A basket of food, blanket, forks and a flask on riding horses. Flowers, heather, and a long meandering solar decline. It was possible, Charles said, they could see the Perseids shortly after sundown. If they were lucky, a blizzard of stars would fall right to them.

The horses ambled up the River Sprint and crossed at Garnett Bridge. They cut across sheepfolds and stiles. Above Dockernook Gil they camped for a supper of scotch eggs and pork pie. Aalunae related stories of her adventures in far off lands. Charles made up mythical manufactures that nurtured quiet farm and mill families. They counted grouse and minnows and crickets.

As the sun dropped they scrambled up the escarpment above the still waters of Gurnal Dubs. They spread the blanket on bare rocks. The moon rose low on the horizon. Stars scattered slowly across the sky, waiting.

"I was named for a river. And I see a river in the sky. I declare it to be my river.

Aalunae drew an arc across the sky.

"She is your orb too.

Charles reached out to the moon. It hung a finger's breath above the dark land. Far higher than the sliver of moon he remembered from Wrangel. Then, it had tugged at him. Calling to him from the warmth of the south. He had been lost above seventy-one north and thirty below. He had thought then of the girl who was, in his mind, named for that moon. Charles shivered, his body remembering how he had then. Now, he was unbelievably here. Not alone. Unconsciously, he shifted closer to Aalunae.

"All this is for you. I name you Luna. Muse of the moon, Queen Of the Sky.

He felt a touch on his shoulder. Aalunae was scanning the heavens. Clutching him to anchor herself to the knott.

"And you, sir, I dub Aurorae of Borealis. Bora. King Of the Northern Lights.

She leaned into him. Their shoulders touched. Their hips touched. Her leg nuzzled against his. He had never been so close to another person. He stopped breathing. He froze, even as an unfamiliar heat within him rose. Charles held so still. The slightest movement could not improve a tingling perfection he was terrified to lose.

Soon shooting stars fell like snow. They counted them for hours.

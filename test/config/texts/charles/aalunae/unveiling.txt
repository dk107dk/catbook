>1932 - A Chesterian discovery near Kendal

Aalunae Chesterian's mother had told her once that their house on Low Fellside Way was built in the sixteen hundreds. Her mum had thought there was probably a structure there even earlier. She wasn't sure. History fades if it is not told and retold.

From that time, the building's evolution had never stopped. Every few years some part was new, rebuilt, extended, resurfaced. Smaller houses were put up on either side housing various generations. In good times, younger walls were of quarried dimension stone. At some point, a subbasement was dug out for cooler storage. A circular drive was laid out in front of the row. A few decades later, it was removed as the row built forward.

Little additions grew into important appendages. Lean-tos became sheds became barns became mews became carriage houses. These were converted to more row houses on a new perpendicular byway, Stony Lane.

The land on the near side of the lane had been fellfields. It grew a cluster of brick and stone boxes. They multiplied, divided, sprouted chimneys, and budded windows and doors. Inside, threshing, milking, mashing, jarring, the making of pottery, the making of soap, and finally the making of Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cakes.

Kendal is famous for its mint cakes. Mint cakes are boiled and whipped sugar. The recipe was discovered accidentally. Over time, they became the go-to calories for explorers, soldiers, and athletes, as well as pretty much anyone with a sweet tooth. Several Kendal families got into the unusual rural business. Oddly, all were successful. Though, some more so than others. The Fellsmans did well. After Charles Chesterian joined Team Fellsman they did even better.

Aalunae and Charles's marriage was one of the more recently constructed additions. So far, it presented unshakably. Even through the mysteries of childbirth and child-rearing, restless wanderlust, seriously difficult employees, a world war fought and another one brewing, an unparalleled economic depression, the sometimes crazy-making village politics, sickness, death, and the unanswerable motions of the sun, the moon, and the stars. All of it careened across Aalunae and Charles's lives. They rolled with it. Said little and enjoyed it well enough.

"What do you want me to see?

Aalunae was looking at Charles in their large eat-in kitchen. Oak beams. Stone floor. Dried food and oiled iron cookware. Ancient cabinets, dark wood, rather nicely done. The windows were large, for a kitchen. They looked through a shallow greenhouse and into a long narrow yard. Charles had entered from the rough basement steps carrying a box. He had set it gently on the family table. While he had tried to lay the groundwork for this, he wasn't sure he'd done it well.

"Remember I said I had found something odd up in the fells? A couple of months ago I spent some time up near Shipman and Raven Crag. A couple of weekends.

Aalunae turned and looked. Not at the table, not at the box. At Charles. As always, he appreciated her attention. He would have liked her attention to be more on what he was trying to show.

"It was something in the rock. Took a bit to get it out. Breaking the rock took some doing. The more I worked on it the odder it got. I want you to see it.

Aalunae was still looking at Charles. Still not acknowledging the box. Aalunae spent her attention well. She was more concerned to assess Charles than she was interested in the contents of a rough wood box. Charles had lost a finger and two toes when she wasn't watching him.

"I do remember, of course. You've been at it a while. What did it turn out to be?

Aalunae had turned fully round and set aside her cloth by this point. She finally looked at the box. She still didn't see the draw. But Charles obviously did, so she paid mind. Charles replied carefully.

"I'm not yet sure what to make of it. It is more than odd to me, now. I wanted you to see it. Can I tell you about it? Maybe you'll have ideas?

Charles stepped up to the table again and pushed the box forward. Paused. Reached behind him for a lamp on the counter. The kitchen was wired for two low-watt electric lights. The large windows faced South. Still, the lamp would help. What he wanted to show wasn’t easy to see. He lit the lamp and set it by the box. Paused again.

Charles had been wanting to tell Aalunae about the object he found. He wasn't sure how to do it. And that worried him. Aalunae was so practical. She wouldn't protest him working on anything. In this case, he needed more support. And the time he needed it was pretty much right then. So the revealing had to go right. He took a breath.

"Ok. Show me.

"
Charles's story was this.

Spotting the object behind a natural rock fall was a bit of luck. It wasn't large, it was all but hidden, and it was black. He got up close. Knocked on it with a rock. Unquestionably curious, but not something he needed to get engrossed in right then.

Charles continued his ramble uneventfully. He worked his way down Sadgil to the River Sprint and mounted at Aalunae's cousin's outer field. He rode down the Longsleddale following the Sprint till it merged into the Kent north of Kendal.

He considered stopping in at the Odd Fellows pub, then thought better of it. Reached the stable on Stony Lane not long before midnight. The house was dark. Aalunae had left bread and jam in the box. There was milk.

All the following week he thought about what he had seen. But work was consuming. A Norwegian ski race called |Birkebeinerrennet| made a last minute special order. The shipment was held up at the border. Ingredients deliveries were tangled due to some work action to the south. The coal room roof was leaking. Aalasha's headmistress was on about her disinclination to speak the King's English in class. Letters, bills, wages due. A dozen things he could not ignore.

Yet Charles kept returning to this: a three-or-four-inch black cylinder protruding out of solid limestone. Not loose. No grike. No rust. No cement. Nothing in the way of cracks, veins, scoring, or stress features. An seemingly impossible locked-room mystery which was well-started on its way to quietly driving him mad.

Charles left for the dale at four-thirty Saturday morning. His bag held heavy tools, sharp tools, food for a couple of days, rope, a tiny brass lamp, and a second sweater. He mounted a waxed canvas bedroll behind his saddle. Beat up Dorfman Pacific perched above a long oilskin western duster with creases from years in a musty trunk with American railway labels. His old kit was good quality, if foreign. He'd be high up before the town's ham was cooked.

Charles's bag also held a gift box for his cousin's kids. A fringe benefit of making candy for a living. His opinion on this point was firm, and backed by experience: it didn't matter if mint cakes were taking you up Mount Everest or Mount Erebus, they were still candy.

Reversing his return from six days prior, Charles followed the River Sprint through Skelsmergh into Longsleddale. Past Sadgill. He left his horse in his cousin's top vaccary, below the outcrops of Shipman Knotts on the Kentmere Pike. He, knocked his right boot to settle the custom insole. Laced up tighter. Strode off, bag and roll on back. Under the last stand of trees he spotted a solid stick. He took it with.

Charles wasn't worried about any of the things others might have. Where would he sleep? Could he start a fire? Could he even find the site again? Certainly, yes to all. He had dead reckoned across the unmapped interior of the Seward Peninsula. Alone. On foot. In winter. About half the size of England and bitter cold. A twelve-mile overnight wasn't a bother.

Shipman, Adam Seat, Tarn Crag, Raven Crag. They enclosed him in a vast, solid box of the valley, its false peaks, moraines and screes, small waters, and escarpments. Dead heath, exposed rock. His choice to avoid ancient paths and walls, and to judge the rest by the inverse of difficulty, led to the find. Ramblers following the usual rounds wouldn't come close.

Soon enough he was back on top of the rock fall's rubble. Looking right at it. Six inches away. Was it slightly more protruding than he remembered? He got up close. It had no features. He poked at it with a small sharp pick. It didn't move. He hammered it increasingly hard with a two-pound rock hammer. Nothing. Charles found the formerly enclosing stone and inspected it closely. The cavity was smooth and closed.

It was time for lunch. He got down without falling. Pulled out a hunk of bread and dripping and had a think.

That afternoon he worked the problem. A cheap magnifying glass told him nothing. Chisel, pick, hammer, nothing. The cylinder wasn't loose. Could he make it so? Charles wrapped a bandanna over his mouth and started hammering the rock. The limestone wasn't impossibly hard. There was apparently no need to be careful with the object; nevertheless, he was.

By late afternoon Charles had switched to hammering his medium chisel. He counted the blows it took before a sizable fragment broke off. His arms grew rubbery. He hammered on and on. How long could he go? Did he need to stop? Not yet. Just a few more blows. How about now? No, not yet.

Eventually, it became too dark to see down the narrow eight-inch opening without the lamp. His hands were bruised and torn. The object was impassive. He broke the stick. Gathered some peat and brush. Lit a fire. There were a few stars.

In the morning everything ached. Charles quickly lost patience with not being able to see or hammer easily. By afternoon he had broken a relatively wide scar. By three p.m. the black object lay on the heather. He lay a long time on his back, exhausted.

The socket the cylindrical object came from was perfectly smooth. He couldn't imagine it was drilled in. That would be impossible! There was no residue of binding material. He had broken the containing rock to about half the object's length. Then without warning, it simply slid out as if unlocked.

It was a bit anticlimactic. The object was squared off at each end. A circular tube. Black to the point of being indistinct. Smooth to the point of tactile invisibility. Edges quite crisp. He was grateful to the makers they weren't cutting-sharp. It was more than two feet long. Charles judged its weight to be less than iron. Heavier than fresh-cut Oak. He guessed it probably wouldn't rip his bag. He padded it.

"It was a bear getting it home. My back had a yellow stripe for a week.

Aalunae had a look. She stared. She was unnaturally still. It was a bit disquieting. Charles forged ahead.

"I put it in the workshop. It's been there since. I've been trying to figure it out. I wanted to know something about it before I showed you.

For six weeks the black object had sat locked in the little workshop. At first, carefully wrapped. After a few weeks of increasing respect for its imperturbability Charles handled it less gently. It had broken an old hunting knife. Ruined a saw. And a cleaver. It ignored a log splitter. Charles had tried a farrier's forge and a blowtorch. Nothing. It had barely gotten warm. Drill press, same: it broke bits.

"It was getting expensive. I stopped.

Billy Cheffer, don at Kendal High School, was a friend and customer. Over the years he and Charles had talked at Aalasha's open houses, fundraisers, and other events. The school had a practical chemistry lab. Fairly advanced, for a rural school, reflecting the lower Kent’s decade in, decade out dalliance with small-scale heavy industry.

"I crafted a story about a sales chap who left a sample of a modern insulating storeroom lining he wanted us to purchase. Told Billy I thought him probably a charlatan. But I wanted to be certain, in case it was real.

Billy was happy to help. Charles had a good reputation. He could handle himself around tools and chemicals. What could go wrong? He offered Charles the lab for a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. Charles donated five pounds to the school. Assured Billy he wouldn't make a mess, and no, he didn't need Billy to stick around to watch. Thank you, for offering.

There was more heat. Caustics were deployed. The microscope was jury-rigged. An exceedingly fine-tipped knife dulled. Three hours later Billy returned as it was all wrapping up. Charles hid his disappointment behind his disinclination to purchase the storage liner. The salesman was indeed a crackpot. Charles was grateful to know it. Billy laughed and stuck the favor in his back pocket.

"Now I was really involved. Fascinated, really.

The next weekend Charles returned to the site. On the way up he looked behind him as he climbed as if someone might be following. Arriving, he found nothing had changed. Nobody seemed to have come that way, which was good.

After a few hours of fruitless chipping and hunting about he was done. He applied a large hammer and heavy bar to the rock face in the attempt to make the dig less obvious. He filled the remaining small smooth socket with rock and mud. Charles dug till he found the rock that had originally capped the near end. He had tried to arrange everything unobtrusively. Wished he could cover it all. Then he left.

"Another week of calls and favors got me into a foundry a few miles down the line. I gave a similar story. The furnace and drop hammer did nothing. Not a sausage.

Charles had thanked the supervisor and exited as quickly as possible. His magic cylinder was getting noticed. The lads had never seen anything take such a beating with no effect. He didn't want the attention.

"By this time I had changed sides. Now I was rooting for it. Whatever it is.

How far could he take this? What in wide England would make a dent? What did he have? Who knew? Charles knew he didn't know enough to know what to do next. He needed a materials expert. It was then that he thought of Cayton Burns in Motherwell.

Cay had helped Charles occasionally over the years. They had kept in touch. Cay was an exceedingly practical engineer with heavy tools. If anyone could get a sample, it was him. If he didn't know how to proceed, likely he would know who to send Charles to next. And, perhaps best of all, Cayton was not a talker. Charles trusted him.

All this came out in a rush. Meanwhile, Aalunae had spent most of the few minutes Charles was talking staring at the curious object. She had gotten down close to it. Looked at it from different angles. Especially end on. Closer and closer.

Charles noted that his wife was no longer listening to him. Normally that would have been deflating, if not entirely surprising. In this case, though, she was fully alert. Engaged with the blackness in an unusual way. His story slowed and trailed off. He was watching her now. Her face. Her expression was... strange.

"Does it usually move?

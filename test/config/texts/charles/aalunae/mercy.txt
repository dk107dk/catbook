>1913, 1986 - An attack of memories in Kendal

Aalunae felt a presence. She sensed a person, foreign and unfamiliar. A blunt compression of space. The invader's strangeness interfered with the essence of all the quiet and respectable things that make up a darkened English farmhouse. This wasn't the first intrusion. This time Charles wasn't home.

At Fellfall they had long learned to think in the half mystical terms of science. Aalunae sensed electricity. Atomic bonds, photons, and field lines. Spinning probabilities on the corkboard of time. Even as she waited in fear, she could too easily lose her focus to her and Charles's more and more consuming inner life. Something unfriendly had entered her personal space. And yet, that space had become a vast universe.

Aalunae held her breath in the dark. Her back against a cool wall. She waited. And waited.

Again, losing focus, she was distracted by remembering another slow crisis moment of holding her breath. Many years ago.

She had held her father's hand right at the end. It had been dry as paper. The year of his birth and every year thereafter was written on it. Her father's grip hadn't been entirely gone. Nearly though. She had held her breath to listen for his. Aalunae could do nothing to fix that. She had looked into his pale eyes, red around the edges, yellowed. Old paper. She had waited for the moment. She knew she would know the moment, when it came.

And in the almost alarming clarity of the present memory, Aalunae remembered what she had remembered back then. She had thought about how she had held her breath at a yet earlier such existential crisis. Her mind probed the memory of memory as her tongue probed the sharpness of her shrarded canine. She escaped into her distant past. Her childhood. As if something there could help her.

"
She had drifted away from the village school a year early. Her friends had drifted away too. Her circle had narrowed as her days became ever more vocational. By degrees days ever more housebroken.

A never solitary loner, Aalunae was happy enough in the bustle of the kitchens. When she was fourteen a ragamuffin girl from the parish workhouse had walked into the factory. Slight. Slightly starved. Long hair clumped in chocolate cosmos strands, tangled back in a knot. A girl with eyes that needed to look up to hers. Martine Cossitor was a delicate campanulaceae beaten down by wind and weather. She was eager. She would work hard.

Aalunae's circle had expanded, slightly.

The two girls were well matched. After a few weeks of hot meals Martine could, by squinting her eyes and gathering her breath, shift sugar barrels and carry full pails of coal. She watched everything Aalunae did and did it exactly the same. One night Aalunae came back to the kitchen, having forgotten to damp the stove. She startled Martine in the dark softly singing Celtic folk songs to the fire.

That night Aalunae learned about folk songs and Riverdance. In turn, she began teaching Martine how mint cakes really worked, how making soap worked, about oils and extracts, and how to tell stories without using words. Soon Martine had taught Aalunae all her folk songs. They began to walk the shops on Market, selling and singing together. When spring came, they picked mint together and learned about plants. In the summer they turned sixteen and fifteen just nine days apart from each other.

Martine met young John Kenford that summer. Johnny to his aunt Fae Anne, who ran the Richardson Bakery down in Kirkby Lonsdale. Fae Anne and Aalunae had reached an agreement after introductions by one of Aalunae's satisfied customers. Richardson would buy a few dozen mint cakes, bottles of mint oil, and bars of rosemary soap for distribution up and down the Lune River, outside Kendal where Aalunae and her family maintained their own local customers. Aalunae was, she was told, named after the Lune. The arrangement satisfied. The money wasn't so much compared to the family till. Still, for a fifteen-year-old, it was a good business. Martine helped. Together they were able to make and deliver more goods to Richardson.

On their first trip down to Richardson's Aalunae and Martine set off walking. They walked about a mile till they hitched a ride on a farm wagon. Arrived not too dusty. Fae Anne had known they were coming. However, she was at the back in the shed they rented as a storeroom arguing with the landlord. Johnny was manning the counter and the cutting boards. The counter help was out sick. John was hot and annoyed.

They walked in. John's attitude changed smartly. Martine was dressed simply. Apron hand stitched. Hat unadorned. Dress invisibly unthreading at the hem. Being almost a year in service to Aalunae's family and in the company of her bold friend she marched head held high. John dusted his hands and was attentive. Aalunae introduced them. John spoke carefully. When Fae Anne came in he didn't pull back. He looked at Martine, not Aalunae. This was new territory.

The next month John met the girls halfway along. He drove the store cart up the valley to a roadhouse. As they passed by he hailed them. They were glad to stop. John waved them up to the shade of the side porch. He had sweets. They transacted. He offered candy and conversation. Martine seemed taken, even more than when she had first seen him. Aalunae watched John miss half the conversation. An hour later John mounted the cart and Martine and Aalunae turned back. The much mostly nonverbal bantering made a quick trip back to Kendal. It led Aalunae quickly to the idea that she might not need to make the long walk at all in August.

John and Martine saw quite a bit of each other that summer. That was fine with Aalunae. She threw herself into her work, as contented as ever to make money and learn her crafts. Martine worked just as hard, but her spare time began to involve long walks down to Lonsdale and wheels pulling up late at the Fellsman's kitchen gate. John was ever polite to Aalunae. They bantered a bit. With Martine, he was so attentive as to raise eyebrows with the other Fellsman employees. There was chuckling and at least one askance eye. All in all, it was a good summer.

That fall Martine began causing Aalunae worries. By October she was not infrequently covering for Martine's absence from the little dormitory behind the kitchen. Aalunae would stop in the doorway in the evening to ask if Martine was back from whatever nonexistent errand she had sent her on. That seemed to work. Aalunae didn't think it would work forever.

There were days when Martine came in late to the kitchen. Sometimes well after the factory was humming. After it happened twice Aalunae hid a basket with a block of ash soap and a new package of baker’s powder. When Martine came in late again that week Aalunae was able to raise the basket and thank her for running out for supplies. That kind of trick worked a couple of times. However, it was flimsy. Aalunae had to think up more and more such tricks. She was getting cross. Martine was apologetic on the surface, yet deeply distracted and increasingly careless underneath.

In time, the head draughter, the cook responsible for gauging and pouring the molds, spoke with Aalunae's mum. Sharp words were directed. Mrs. Fellsman was a force not to be trifled with. Aalunae's own annoyance, fueled by something almost panic for her friend, boiled over like a vat of poorly tended mint syrup. Ultimatums and punishment were handed down. Martine looked gray and tearful. She and Aalunae weren’t talking that afternoon.

Still, that night Aalunae came to the dormitory to check on Martine. She wasn't there. Aalunae found her in the latrine shaking and nauseous. Something had to be done. Aalunae thought she knew what. The next day she sneaked into her mum's locked garden shed armamentarium and stole dried pennyrile, scotts broom, and tansy.

Later that evening, she brought the still nauseous Martine into the family's little reading room. They told stories with looks, gestures, and few words to take their minds off the troubles. Would she like a soothing herbal tea? Martine thought that she would. Aalunae bustled off to make it.

At the moment the water boiled Aalunae hesitated. But only for a moment. Then she poisoned the brew. Organics seeped from the tarnished silver infuser as she watched. She remembered a moment of wondering how it would feel to herself drink this. She knew what she intended to do ought to give her pause.

Leavened with honey and milk, Martine sipped the tainted tea. Aalunae tried not to stare. Her pulse was barely raised. Her voice completely steady.

The next morning Martine was unseen. She was quite sick and out of work for days. At night she bit her pillow. John came but found himself unwelcome. Aalunae tried her best to console her friend. Eventually, Martine was back on her feet. Work helped lock the past away in the deep chest of dark times. Any distraction helped.

Did Martine know how it happened? She couldn't know. All Aalunae knew is that she had acted. It was enough, she was satisfied.

Remembering her satisfaction in knowing her friend's life had become calm again. Again thin, but not drawn. Subdued, yes, but not unhappy. Life had picked up slowly. It had returned back to its usual village rhythm. A moment came when laughter was again thinkable. In time summer returned. Aalunae in a certain moment stopped to survey the results of a risk she took willingly. And at that moment it was final: the verdict was good. And she had let out the breath she had been holding.

"
Aalunae remembered so clearly returning to the then-present. Standing beside her father. Refocusing her eyes on him. His face had floating before hers. Dying. So slowly. What did he still see? His eyes were unnaturally still. His breathing was strained. The blotches on his face were dark. His hair glass thin.

Shoulders that had lifted layers of roofing slate. Shoulders that had carried endless buckets of coal. Four-and-a-half-foot tin molds stacked eight high. Slumped and veined. Fermented cabbage. Wilting and slowly drying.

It had been time to do what she felt was needed. She had been sure. Aalunae picked up the glass. Clear with a hint of honeydew and a few delicate flakes swaying at the bottom. She had carefully tipped it to his lips with a gentle hand supporting his neck. This is how it had to happen. Things that had to happen just did. You didn't think. You just acted. It was better that way.

In the end, ultimately, it would become satisfying.

"
And then the memory collapsed. Aalunae came back to the present. The more complicated world of 1986. A creak of a careful foot on a wide oak board. Aalunae was glad Charles wasn't there. She would end it herself.

The door from the dark hall to the dark kitchen slowly opened. A hand in a matte black glove. A foot in the dim light over the dark boards. The unfamiliar person had come to her. The strangeness was right there.

Focus!

Aalunae snapped like a tensioned tendon parting. She moved fast. Swinging her long arm around as she stepped out and leaned through the doorway. Kitchen knife glinting past the window. It cut into something. The shadow's leg jerked back with a muffled cry.

Aalunae half fell into the molding with a grunt. Something heavy shook the frame. She hip-bounced off the casing and swung again wildly without waiting to recover. As hard as she could. Balance be damned. Again, she connected with something firm.

Then the shape of the invader was before her. Black on black in the dim of the hall. Movements so quick. The shape was gone, replaced by an urgent blur. Something slammed into the bridge of her nose. A noise like wet cabbage dropping on the block. Her world went red and then dark. She flew backward.

Aalunae was gone before she knew what she would hit. And yet, in going, she was satisfied. She had sensed the moment and she had acted. That was enough.

Many hours later Charles entered the dark house. He found his wife on the kitchen floor. Heavy objects thudded into the walls. Glass shattered. Again and again. The Longsleddale fells echoed. There were tears. Later the rain came.

"
A woman entered Kendal Station in muddy black wellingtons. Black jeans and a backpack under a dark plastic poncho. She hurried to the payphone and made an efficient call.

"I'm heading South. There was a complication.

A man's voice. Low, expressionless.

"Tell me later. Do you have it?

The answer was tense.

"No. The barn was empty. It is gone. Just more journals and papers. Some of it is in code.

Less than a minute later the woman tightened her hood awkwardly with one hand. She left the station walking south, favoring her left leg. A mile below town she left the road.

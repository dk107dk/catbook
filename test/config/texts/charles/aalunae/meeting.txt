>1910 - Charles first encounters Aalunae in Kendal

The young woman at the counter was looking down. She tapped rapidly between her fingers with a schoolhouse pencil. Had she been a large deckhand with heavy boots playing pinfinger with a marlinspike, Charles Chesterian wouldn't have stiffened and stopped. As it was, the girl looked like she was doing mathematics on the human equivalent of an abacus. Charles drifted towards the counter. Unsure. Waiting to be acknowledged.

Aalunae looked up. The man looked like a Windermere fisherman in a heavy knit highlands sweater and suspenders. But the thin beard was too neat. His curly hair halted with precision a quarter inch above the helix. Muddy boots hinted at a shine. Shoulders leaned back in a muscular ready-all. A dockyard neckerchief half hid a crisp collar buttoned to the top. He was a conundrum from another part of England, dressed like a local, and waiting for her welcome.

Spoken words were never Aalunae's first resort. Talking didn't keep her fractured tooth warm. She didn't say: What can I do for you?

She expressed the question using a soft tilt of her head, slight parting of her lips and a directive tap of the pencil. Charles effortlessly picked the signal out of the semaphore.

"I'm provisioning an arctic voyage.

Charles said this aloud, as one does. He didn't move. He wasn't clear he had leave. His voice was matter-of-fact. In another context he might have hoisted a proud inflection. Not in this village store. The arctic was a concept as strange and abstract as Kilimanjaro.

Aalunae didn't reply: What is it you need? I'll help if I can.

Eyes up, eyebrows peaked, head down, hands up on the counter in the pose of a saint offering succor to the poor. Actually vocalizing wouldn't have made her clearer.

"My ship needs mint cake, K boots, sealing wax, and raw Herdwick vests. Er, perhaps copper cookware of the Keswick School.

The first two were an absolute necessity. Mint cake and Kendal boots were why he came north. For Herdwick, a quick drying and coarse loft wool, he could find substitutes, if needs be. The copper cookware was mostly just Charles rattling on nervously under the gaze of the counter help. He was fascinated. What would her first words be?

Aalunae finally relented.

"We can fill a first order here. But my aunt cannot sell you a ship's worth of anything.

Charles wasn't surprised

"I thought I'd ask here first. Honestly, this is the first place I tried. Is there a better way?

There was indeed a better way. The General Store provided Charles with four flats of fifty mint cakes. It seemed right to Aalunae that she sell out before she took the business wholesale. Then they spent an hour on wool and boots. Aalunae helped Charles understand the options he would have at the factory doors.

To do that, Charles had to tell the story of the upcoming voyage. The young naval officer was eager to do so. As ever the youngest hand in conversations with serious men Charles had little opportunity to talk freely. Fresh off northern sea trials, he had much to relate. As he found Aalunae attentive, he unlaid a tangled line of north sea misadventures: heartbreaking whaler wreckage on Spitsbergen, hazing rituals at Scapa Flow, salt flogging for stolen tobacco, and gagging down |garnat√°lg|.

Aalunae eventually pointed out that the afternoon was waning, though, not in so many words.

"I should get these to the wagon. And get round to the factories.

She wrote the bill and he paid it. They piled up mint cakes, wool, and wax. He would return for the rest. She helped him get under the flats. Charles peered around his burdens and navigated for the entrance. Aalunae nimbled around him to hold the door. She stood one foot in the store, one on the first stone step. As well as the lintel, there were three.

Charles's voice came muffled from behind. Returning to his starch and polish undercoat.

"Thanking you ma'am.

Encumbered. Unfamiliar. The damp of early winter.

Charles put a foot wrong. His right slid forward. He involuntarily goose-stepped into a whole-body spring that twisted him back. It wrapped him in a clockwise corkscrew come about. His right shoulder heaved towards the sky. Posterior inferior aggressively ripping at his latissimus dorsi. His head knocked back hard against the mast as his hands failed to find a line. Suddenly he was airborn over the edge of the low shop stairs and into the scuppers. The paving stones broke his fall. Luckily for him, they broke nothing else.

Charles untangled himself from the nothing he tripped over. He retrieved wax sticks and wool. He looked up. Aalunae's eyes were laughing. She had calmly lifted the mint cake flats from him as he spun. Now she just waited for him to recomboble.

Aalunae had poise. She was not, however, unscathed in the incident. Charles, blushing, realized he had unintentionally struck his new acquaintance. Lifting the flats out of her arms he noticed a shining drop. At the corner of Aalunae's smile a tiny drop of blood trickled from where her unnaturally sharpened canine clipped her bottom lip. He was transfixed.

"I'm frightfully sorry! What a clumsy arse I am. And you caught those perfectly.

Charles paused to take her in. Eyes that spoke to him. Graceful balance. Her teasing smile. The bloody lip. The look was the crest of a wave. It drew and channeled him. All but unending. It would float him to the edge of the world.

And then they were done. Dusk was coming. Duty called. He turned and walked away.

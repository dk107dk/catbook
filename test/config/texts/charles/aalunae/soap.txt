>1908 - A village girl's vengeance in Kendal

Well before she met Charles Chesterian, Aalunae Cithara Fellsman had shown a talent for mechanical and chemical production. She absorbed it from her hardworking parents. At an early age she learned to crush limestone in a grinder designed with her father. She cooked it in a stone kiln her mother helped her build. She learned to render fats and lye from musty books with stained pages. Aalunae poured soapbatter into stone molds. They set in a cool dry place. Time passed. Then the crÃªpe paper she cut wrapped the soap bars she broke.

Having mastered manufacturing, it was time for Aalunae to sell. This was a harder challenge. She started with advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, her parents' firm had distribution, so she was, in a roundabout way, already known. Yet, on the other hand, that distribution channel had been set up long before by grandparents, aunts, and uncles; whereas, her own parents said little about the house beyond a gruff |save yer breath to cool yer porridge|. Needless to say, salesmanship was not practiced at home.

Nevertheless, Aalunae bravely walked into the village shops one by one. In a country of five thousand High Streets across its seven thousand towns and villages, this was a crucial skill. By thirteen, Aalunae became popular with the shopkeepers. Partly for her polite spunk. But more because her soaps in red, beside her parent's Fellsman's Kendal Mint Cakes in blue, didn't trouble them for shelf space long.

Having a little money in her apron didn't trouble Aalunae. However, a boy did.

Robert Gil Wainwright had a bad eye. Robert Junior. It was said from a drunken punch Senior gave him on his return from the schoolhouse to pay for a damaged book. Senior didn't like spending his infrequent money on other than drink.

Senior's family, a thinning line of craftsmen, had taken a wrong turn. His father had identified that rather than sell carts for hauling brew there was more money in selling brew itself. He built the brewery that did for his son. Senior sampled the produce while his father ran the business. When his father died, Senior consumed the brew, the brewery debt consumed him, and Robert Junior drank the bitter trapped in a small town bottle with an alcoholic father. He was far from better things. It did not make him easy to like.

And in turn, he didn't like Aalunae. He didn't like her unusual name. He didn't like her family's success. He did like the sugar Aalunae's parents turned into mint cake in their little factory. He definitely did not like that he couldn't afford sweets. And while he wouldn't admit it, he liked Aalunae's raw good looks. And in turn, the jealousy of all that want became a low boil of something like hatred that malted and fermented well.

For that reason, when Junior saw Aalunae skipping up Lower Fells Way carrying the empty box of wares he stuck a foot from the doorway and caught her leg mid-stride. She went down. Hard. Aalunae never forgot that moment of cascading at the paving stones. It was like slipping stupidly on the crick rocks on a foggy day: a moment of knowing, when the world fades to an urgent blur before the hit, and then the hit. She thought to herself:

"Oh, no, this is not good.

Junior watched her fall and scatter on the sidewalk, hitting her head on the curb. He watched her chip her left canine into a sharp bleeding point she would feel for the rest of her life. He watched the skin peel off her hands and knees. The stone was new. Its edges bit.

Her box slid into a grating and rebounded. Junior saw schillings and pence loosed as if bread to ducks. He saw them as better loosed to him to buy sweets and soda. He laughed the laugh of a boy who got what he wanted and is mostly sure he won't be called to account for it. Quickly he picked up the most available coins. Walked away whistling in anticipation of sweets.

Life is full of moments of little measure with unimaginable results. Senior's father's whipping for a stolen bottle of beer. Senior's punching Junior for the price of a disrespected book of schoolboy geography. Junior's tripping of Aalunae in jealousy of her carefree happiness in hard work. Aalunae's revenge handed down so unexpectedly brutal. Little things.

"
Aalunae controlled every aspect involved in the making of soap. In particular, she mixed her own lye. She was exceedingly careful. In soapmaking, lye is converted in the soapification process as it mixes with triglyceride from oils. Done right, the process makes the dangerous, luxurious.

Aalunae mixed a blend of fats she had concocted over the years since her mother showed her the basics. Typically, she superfatted the batter for a softness her customers appreciated. As the fats consumed the lye, she mixed in other ingredients to exfoliate the skin or smell like the spring or become minty fresh.

However, she knew from a bad childhood experience: too little fat would result in caustic burning soapy non-soap not fit for human skin.

"
"Luna, look here, girl. Now!

Aalunae's mum was a stern presence. When teaching her seven-year-old, she was caring but tough. Sometimes though, when she was teaching something she wanted Aalunae to learn well, just tough.

"Put your hands here. This is the soap you made last week. Wash.

Little Aalunae stood on a chair and made tiny bubbles come from the tiny misshapen bar of soap. It tingled. Then it burned. Her dimpled child's hands turned red quickly. She pulled away gasping. Her mum grabbed her and bent her over the sink, pressing her weight on Aalunae's back. She picked up the painful soap and lathered Aalunae's arms. It burned deep.

"Pay attention! You made soap uncarefully. What you made burns. You must feel it so you know the mistake.

The scars on Aalunae's arms faded quickly. Baby skin is resilient. The lesson was the lasting scar.

"
In the spring of 1908, as Aalunae's older knees healed her anger at Junior remained caustic. She raised the temperature with dark looks and sharp whispers in class whenever Junior decided to make an appearance at school. He didn't fail to notice. The dark looks escalated with Aalunae's hard-sole country shoe colliding with Junior's ankle. An innocent misstep without apology. It was more than sharp enough. She tongued her sharpened tooth and hurried home to work.

The next day Aalunae carried a new batch of soaps in a large flat box. Neatly wrapped in bright red paper. Ready for delivery after school. As she walked in, she made a show of offering one of the bars to the Principal as he left the room. A smile. Much obliged, indeed Miss Fellsman! And to the teacher Mrs. Brey, who also showed great appreciation. In the afternoon Aalunae ordered things such that she was out of the room at the bell. Her bright soaps lay in their box, open on her desk. Undefended. Inviting.

Junior came up from the back. He always sat at the back, of course. No one was looking as the students hurried out. Mrs. Brey was in the hall. Junior quickly closed and scooped up the box and quickly slipped out of the room, down the hall, through the side doors, and off the grounds.

Up three narrow streets to the stone bridge over the river. At the second arch, he opened the box. Dumped the red papered bars into the water. He knew their value. Remembering the pleased look on the Principal's face, and with a mild curiosity, one bar found its way into his pocket. Junior stomped on the box and left it on the stones. He hoped someone would see it or the red wrappers and know.

That evening Senior wasn't in evidence. Junior opened the soap package. Raised it to his nose and smelled the mint. It smelled like sweets. Junior was not overly concerned with cleanliness. Still, like most people, he found a clean face is more pleasant than going to bed with an oily face sporting a day's grime. He filled the basin and lathered up.

Incompletely consumed lye doesn't burn immediately. It coats the skin. Slips into the pores. Trickles down the throat. Leaks into the eyes. And then builds up its heat and biting. Cells burst. Blood leaks. Nerves are shocked and fired.

Junior first felt a tingle. He concluded that was of the nature of high-class soap. The tingle heated up quickly and disabused him of that. His eyes burned. They would be permanently watery from the injury, at least until the next insult. Frantically he cranked both handles and soused his head with cold water. It burned. Luckily for him, the lye was only so strong. His face ended up disfigured. Raw skin too painful for the pillow. Tears through burnt lids. Probably it would heal. Too soon to say.

In the early morning, he rose after little sleep. Donned his coat carefully, his neck painful. He left the otherwise empty house quietly. In the yard, he picked up a rusted half-inch bar, two-and-a-half-foot long. His burnt face uncomfortably tight. He marched over the hill to Aalunae's family's semi-detached fieldstone house.

Up steps. Yanked open the unlocked door. Strode to the kitchen at the back of the house. Aalunae was washing the breakfast dishes and cleaning the kitchen with a vinegar solution. Her parents had already left for the factory. She was alone.

Junior raised the bar and advanced quickly. A wide plank creaked against its square nails. Aalunae spun around and dodged the iron. It smashed a cup and plates by the sink. She tripped and fell into a solid cupboard door, crunching her shoulder painfully. Struggled with a tangling kitchen chair. Junior pulled back to strike. She kicked the straight-back chair into his shins. He howled. His eyes watered, making it hard to see. It slowed him down.

Aalunae hauled herself two lower cabinets over, reached in, pulled an earthenware jug of her best lye. Stumbled to her feet and emptied the jug in Junior's face. Knowing her chemistry, while he screamed she reached past him. Pulled vinegar from beside the sink and sent it after the lye.

As the exothermic reaction ripped into him she hit him with his own iron bar twice, two-handed. Right in the head. He went down and lay motionless. She poured the remains of the lye carefully. Watched his twitching for enough seconds to know his future self to be well and truly ruined.

After a minute or so to catch her breath and stop shaking, Aalunae proceeded to save Junior's life. She then walked unsteadily to a neighbor's house for help and the authorities. Inside her, she was not crying at all. In fact, the outcome was very much to her satisfaction.

The spunky child, still with sweet looks, had deep lye burns on her hands. She began rendering her future in earnest.

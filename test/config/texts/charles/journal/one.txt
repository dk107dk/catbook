>1931 - Charles's Journal, Kendal

"Date: 10 October
"Topic: need a plan

"Found a notebook. Ripped out the arctic entries.

"My goals for this journal:
" - Track attempts
" - Record results
" - Notes of research

"Worth doing?

"Cleared a space in the farriery. This will be my bench for investigations.

"Put a padlock on a cabinet to hold my work. Bolted a second latch on the door. The window locks. The shade works.

"Told Luna and the hands I would be mending a small forge. There may be smoke or noise. Accurate enough. That will buy me a week or so. Maybe more.

"Drawing a blank. Tomorrow I'll plan. Collect tools.

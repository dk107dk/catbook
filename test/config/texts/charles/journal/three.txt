"Date: 21 June
"Topic: Screw engine failure

"At Keyham we had devices for carving metal parts. A lathe for bolts, piston rods, etc. I had an idea that a capstan power lathe with a carbide bit could make some kind of mark.

"Al Hansfurth introduced me to his nephew, Jack Dorsets. Drove the Bedford down to Jack's metal shop north of Lancaster Saturday. Jack has a Herbert No. 2. – 330 volt engine, hexagon turret. Great for screw cutting, but it only takes a 2" bar stock.

"I explained the mystery over a pint. Anyway, enough to make a metals man sit up.

"We headed south to see a mate of his that takes unusual jobs. Rakney Tool and Die. Dai Rakney was a piece. He had fewer fingers than me, wore two pairs of glasses, and was more oiled than my range coat.

"Dai mounted an open-bed Ames Chicopee lathe. – 7.5" volume new, but he had rejiggered it for larger stock. 500 volts, 10 hp engine, 16 speeds. Power ram. A nice model, indeed.

"We worked for a couple of hours. Broke a succession of carbide steel bits – various sizes. High-speed steel, treated carbide, molybdenum-enriched, etc. Laid nary a scratch on it.

"Even with its low coefficient, the bits suffered. But the attempted cutting was dead silent. Just motor and drivetrain. The contact surface, not a sound – it was eerie.

"About an hour in we were at low ebb. There was a sudden shriek from the contact edge. The machine bucked. The bit fairly exploded. A treated alloy block chisel in fine condition – blown to ribbons. Still not a scratch. Same thing two more times before we belayed it.

"I insisted on paying for the bits. Dai let me pay for one. The others he said were custom made by a friend at an advanced materials lab and there was no way to assign a cost.

"I asked them to not say a word. I think they will honor my request.

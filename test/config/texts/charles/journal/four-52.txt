>1935 - Charles's Journal, Kendal

"This is not going well.

"Returned late last night. The Artifact is safe. Luna is fine. I've been watching the lane and listening. Nothing.

"At the minimum, London was a disaster. Huxley is a scoundrel!

"At this point I am unwilling to continue this blasted science foppery. I'll talk with Luna again this evening. But for all me, we secure it in the cellar, put out the lights, double-lock the door, and never speak of the Artifact again.

"
"I suppose I should record what happened.

"Just in short. I was to meet Huxley in London to meet Sidney William Wooldridge, a noted Geomorphologist at King's College, at his lab. I knew Wooldridge's name from others – he was on my list. It seemed likely to be worthwhile – whatever I'd thought of Huxley at Brockhurst.

"I thought it would be a quick trip – two long days. Three, if something good shook loose. I was mistaken. Nothing good.

"Huxley's man met me at the Victoria – that was the first surprise. But I thought nothing of it. He's a man of resources, so. I was straightaway shuttled to the college in a chauffeured coach. Again, not expected, but I suppose I hadn't thought.

"When we got there, it was just ten a.m. This was Sat. I hadn't eaten, under-slept, could have used a wash. Huxley's man quick marched us up from the Strand to King's Building. We collected two more along the way. When we acquired the footman guard was when I began to feel queasy. I expected to arrive on my own, meet two or three people quietly, and leave.

"The backbenchers whisked me off the quad to a smallish room at the left of the foyer. There they handed me off to Huxley – done up full-on don. He was delighted to see me. He was sure we'd have a productive day. There were people I should urgently meet.

"I heard names and immediately pulled out my notebook like a trained poodle. Wooldridge, who I was there to see, but also John Lennard-Jones, Owen Willans Richardson, William Edward Gibbs, Kathleen Lonsdale, and more I didn't catch or can't decipher. Meanwhile I'm gibbering and he's going one hundred miles per hour, about what all who knows? At that point I can see I'm riding a berg due south.

"You're going to lecture on the Artifact, he says. Just like we did with Hanbury. A discourse on the find – he says it like it's our find. His find. Infuriating. And ridiculous – all I did was hammer it out of the bogging rock. And all he did was listen a scant few minutes and spout off a bloody feck-tonne.

"Next thing I know Huxley's scudding me into Great Hall. I know it was Great Hall only because I caught sight a sign as we blew past. Pillars and florid capitals – high ceiling – maybe twenty rows. About six or eight of them full. Everyone stood and turned. Dons, fellows, men with sharp tailors. All speaking over one another. I shook a few hands just to ward them off – gobsmacked.

"The next hour was an unexculpated catastrophic shitehouse. I don't know what I said. I heard Huxley take over the discourse several times when I faltered. I don't remember putting the Artifact's case down. I wish I hadn't have brought it!

"Servers brought coffee and I kept chucking it down. There were digestives. I was starved. At one of the moments where men were preaching some theory back and forth I started stuffing my mouth. My mood blacker than the coffee. I was working on how and when to excuse myself.

"Suddenly Huxley was reaching for the Artifact's case. I was too surprised to move quickly – I almost choked. I was doubled over getting the biscuit out and he was pulling it out of its case. Dropping it, again, like a duffer. Holding it up high like his trophy – his!

"I'd never thought to lock the case – under ordinary circumstances no one would get it out of my hands. I keep a coin bag and a Scot's dirk on me. But what was I going to do? Knife a Royal Society sir so and so in front of a crowd of foppish academics?

"Huxley was making to walk the Artifact around. I fairly leapt off the podium. Near tackled him. I got it into the case, grabbed my bag and jacket, and tried to not run for the doors. Total pandemonium behind me. Men pulled my arms – I shook them off.

"There were men at each door. And large blokes who didn't look academic in the last row. None of them moved fast enough. One of the fops at the middle door got in my way. I put him on the floor none too gently.

"Once out I ran. Half in my coat. I had the case and my overnight. My hat and umbrella were lost. I got lucky with a cab. Kept an eye on my wake. I couldn't tell if I was followed. We got to Victoria and I bought a seat on the next north west. I got my back in a dark corner and watched everyone.

"Even with all that nervous energy and vigilance I almost lost it – they almost took it. I don't know what I would have done.

"When the train was announced fifteen minutes later I got caught in a crush at the top of the platform. Just a moment's jam up, but someone jostled me hard from the left. I was off balance for a moment – at the same time the strap of the case let go. I wasn't meant to feel the cut, but luckily I did.

"A boy almost got the Artifact and got away. Well, he had a step on me, but I had the bulk to push through the crowd and I caught him – I took the case from him. At the same time I gave him a head punch that knocked him onto the tracks. Of course someone else put him up to it – but I still hope I damaged him good.

"I got aboard – steaming. Hands shaking. After that, nothing.

"The journey was rot. I must have got the worst train. It took three changes to get north to Manchester. Two more for home. I couldn't sleep. My knife stayed loose in my jacket pocket. Every whistle, crowd, carriage door slam, or loud voice set me off.

"I obviously don't know what that was. Who could it have been? – Huxley? Maybe. Or did Huxley just talk to the wrong person? Maybe Hanbury or someone else I've talked with myself let word get around. How long were they watching me? Just that same day – or worse than that?

"I don't know what next. Those horse fucking scientifically effete buggers – never again. We're done. We go dark.

"If I see any scut casing the lane they're going to bloody well wish I hadn't.

"
"  God, how I suddenly miss the ice.

"
"    There are hardships that nobody reckons;
"        There are valleys unpeopled and still;
"    There’s a land — oh, it beckons and beckons,
"        And I want to go back — and I will.

"June 10:

"As noted, I contacted Julian Huxley after yet another "lesser wizard" said to consult him. I've been many months mucking about with experts. Not much to show for it.

"But apparently they all know Huxley. Or at least they want to look like they do.

"Huxley and I exchanged mail several times since January. All logged.

"I thought it a long shot. An attention-seeking evolutionary biologist chummy with science fiction writers? Right. But I knew nothing of him. I'm sure he wondered about me as well – a washed up arctic hand pursuing atomic physics. The queerness might well have got his attention.

"We agreed to meet. Huxley invited me to a weekend at Brockhurst, West Sussex, as a guest of Frederick Janson Hanbury. Hanbury is a citizen scientist. The estate includes botanical gardens and an observatory. Quite a distance for a shot in the dark. With some misgivings, I agreed.

"We have to crack this. How many years? How many quid? Is it important enough to pack a bag? Yes. If we found the right person with the right answers maybe we could stop carrying this weight ourselves. Stop hiding something – a potentially harmful something – even from our own flesh and blood. The thought of the years makes me tired.

"Well, I got to Grinstead early Sat. on the overnight express. I kept to myself in town for a bit. I didn't want to show up before elevenses. By that point, I didn't want to show up at all. It's one thing to drop into a lab at Oxford. I'm getting used to that kind of thing. Brockhurst is a stately home. Sure, I've done that, haven't I, once, but still.

"Eventually I found a ride to the estate. The gate was a lane through the trees past a private pond with a boat house and fields. On a rise I saw a smallish peaked two-story building that looked to be the observatory. I walked slow.

"The lane circled round to the house. I rang at a modestly grand entrance and a houseboy brought me in, took my coat and things. I had a small overnight, in case, and the custom case with the Artifact in it. That I kept with my person.

"I find myself calling it the Artifact, now. That was Huxley. He squared it into his humanist worldview he had cooked up. Artifacts – he categorized – are materials humans create. "Sociofacts" are the constructs of peoples – politics, I suppose. And "Mentifacts" are the abstract ideas of the culture.

"But I'm getting ahead.

"As I found out, Hanbury and Huxley were mates at King's College, the Royal Society, other environs out of my league – they go long back. Hanbury runs the family's chemicals company. Orchids, observations – meteorological and astronomic – botanical collections, and monographs, all well-thought of, for an amateur.

"Huxley, by his say, cut an even higher figure. Both knew a little geology. In practical terms, my best footing was their least. In short, men of substance who probably wouldn't have answers but would know who does.

"Or, anyway, that's the hope.

"We soon retired to the conservatory. Over lunch we got into the long view of evolution, geologic time, and the rise of humankind – the sweep of change. Great talkers. I couldn't move things along.

"After lunch Hanbury took us round to a cottage adjacent. Cottage, not likely – a three story house, by me. On the first floor a high open stable space. It was given over to a make-shift carpentry shop where one of his men was crafting fine display cases for his geology collection. Among other things, he had metamorphics from the fells with what he said were their sedimentary protoliths. Looked right to me.

"I finally got their attention on why I was there. We got back to the house and I grabbed the case. I talked them through how I found the Artifact. What I had done to investigate it and the rock it came out of. The indestructibly. All the unlikely measurements. The strange things we've seen.

"Huxley didn't bite – the Artifact just sat in its case while he talked about inclusions, faults, erosion. He spoke convincingly. But I've heard it. He was maundering to prove he could expound, it felt like.

"I took notes.

"A chap from Norway by the name of Knut Fægri is developing a means of dating formations by what he calls Lichenometry – clever fellow.

"Did I remember the covering of the face? Well no, I didn't. But certainly there was moss, lichen, and the like. How does that help us with the impossible internal placement? Honestly, it made no sense. He dropped it. Hanbury picked up with the next thing and they kept it up, traded back and forth.

"Finally, I just offered to show it. It was like they forgot I had carried something with me all day. Just like everyone I see, they just hop over the exhibit to get to their own words. Perhaps I need a more flamboyant case? Anyway, I opened it. Like everyone, they didn't see anything special.

"Then Huxley tried to pick it up. And like with everyone who tries, who knows what they'll experience?

"Heavy, no question – and something new: like a gyroscope, it didn't want to turn. That apparently made it hard to hold. Huxley dropped it. I shouldn't wonder if the floor dented. He looked shocked and embarrassed. I almost laughed in his face.

"Hanbury had a bit better luck, though he struggled. Both of them, well, jolly well impressed. It sinks in on you – I've seen it many times now.

"Over the next couple hours I told them more about the observations – the experiments. Showed them photographs of the site.

"Their wonder slowly turned back into high-brow talk-talk. This was when Huxley got into his humanistic groove.

"His point, summarizing heavily, was that a machined object embedded in fifty-million-year-old rock breaks all kinds of philosophies, certainties – mentifacts – all shattered by a small unimposing, indestructible black artifact.

"It all made sense, when he said it. Still, I was a bit roughed. It was an unprovoked diatribe. Why? – too prove what to who? I suddenly imagined Stefansson going on about the challenge of the arcticularity to the certitude of the modern world. That put me off.

"I would certainly not follow this Huxley into the wild. Men would die!

"But still, I stayed the night after all. We were up till all hours with scotch and soda and books and maps.

"Sun. morn at breakfast Huxley bade me return south, soon. He had a geomorphist and a physical chemist he wanted to look at the Artifact at King's. Both Royal Society – top flight. He said they were practical men who would get to the bottom of this.

"I've heard that before. But, why not? – what do I have to lose, right? Actually, though, Luna thinks probably quite a bit. She worries.

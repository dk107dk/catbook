>1931 - Charles's Journal, Kendal

"Date: 15 December
"Topic: heat

"Continuing hot work with torch and furnace.

"Switched to the bituminous. Wasted a week cooking my own coke. Worth the cost of a load from Dawsons.

"Repaired and mounted a flywheel bellows with hand crank as a blowing engine for the furnace. Works well.

"Electrics? Steam?

"
"Stupid mishap today. One hand for yourself, one for the ship. Hammer the hand you cut. Bollocks!

"I fired it. No change in color. It took up no heat. None. Impossible -- but it was cool to touch. I was bloody well blinkered. I put my unlucky hand on the wretched tongs. Assuredly not cool! I don't think anyone heard me howl.

"Soaking the sodding four now. For the first time in a long while I wish I was on the ice.

"No more today. Probably done for several days.

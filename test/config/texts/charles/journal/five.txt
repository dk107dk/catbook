"Aug. 5.  I̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶n̶k̶ we have a problem.

"People are beginning to talk.

"Last week, one of the post office ladies asked Luna to settle a bet about how old she was. She laughed it off.

"Then yesterday, Alan Danny asked how I keep so fit. Men like me don't ask other men how they keep fit. – I would never.

"We've been trying to ignore it – I feel half my age. Luna too. It's good – she looks good. But at this point it's bloody well not normal!

"It has to be the Artifact – somehow. What else?

"I'd say just another bloody mystery and move on. – Except people get suspicious of what they don't understand. Then afraid. Then they get hostile.

"Who knows what next?

"We need a plan. And we need an idea of what the devil is going on. We were right to keep the Artifact hidden. It's good Lasha is far away. But who do we confide in?

"I know this much: this time we shan't bollix it up with so-called experts we can't speak back to. Why not educate ourselves? – become our own experimentalists.

"We are already the World's greatest experts on the Artifact. That's a good place to start.

>1934 - Charles's Journal, Kendal

"Date: April 3rd.

"I leave tomorrow on my first formal visit. Bearding an esteemed scientist in his campus digs feels like an expedition. It has been many years.

"I'm to see Al Harker on Thursday. The trip to St John's, Cambridge, may be my longest since the Wrangel rescue. This time, comfortable and dull – no risk of frostbite, so good.

"I only wish my first visit was Harker's past collaborator, Alfred Wegener. Sadly, Wegener's gone. A polar explorer. He created a seal gut and bone banjo while staring down winter on the ice. More to the point, his "continental drift" seems topical. At least I knew him – damn loss!

"I have been reading Petrology and related topics. Not enough, really. But I'm practiced at asking questions I don't understand. I know my story – I'll tell it so as he can hear.

"Sequences of sedimentary limestone and sandstone in the most closely encapsulating layers, bounded by layers of harder metamorphic slate. How was it all formed? At some time during the 10,000 years of Britain's inhabitation might the layers have somehow been remolded? Surely not.

"I have to be careful how I say it –

"According to Phillip at Victoria Uni, Harker is the man to see about rocks. From what I hear, he is a chap that understands field hardships. I’m bringing samples from the site – he doesn't need to know where from.

"I had our harness maker create a custom case. Handsome leather stretched on a light pine frame. Brass corners. I had him make a cork insert to hold the object. It looks jolly good – no one would think.

"Lately I have dreams. In them, it misbehaves. I make excuses. Imagine if it made sounds in the carriage. Or what if it heated up? I'd prefer not to find myself in flames – or to watch it melt into the earth.

"How dangerous is it, really?

"Will I actually show it to Harker? What would that prove? Could he explain anything from inspecting it? Would he insist on talking about it with his dons?

"Luna thinks we should leave it locked up. Leaving it when there is a chance to learn is unthinkable! Little Lasha playing unaware a few dozen feet from it when I'm hundreds of miles off? – Never!

>1969 - Charles's Journal, Cambridge, England

"Mar 15. In Cambridge yet again. Arrived Sunday.

"I'm at the University Arms again. The lounge – why? – reminds me of the Kontor. The furnishings? Perhaps the scent? Leather, wood oil, something. Quiet and slow – simpler times.

"This time to see that son of a sea captain, Dirac – again. Will he show? I hope, if only to make the trip something. Not risk for nothing.

"See log: Feb 20, 25.

"Paul Dirac is said to be half-mad – but a genius. I have met so many. Mostly rum idiots.

"I wish Paul were here. He'd suffer brilliant fools better.

"Questions to draw out Dirac:
"   1) Could a material have some kind of "inner life"? Something so small and internal to its atoms, yet with the ability to sense and interact with its surrounds?
"   2) What could power an object for millennia without consuming itself? Would an external material supply be required? Or might there be some – again – an internal resource that could be tapped?
"   3) How could such an object sense or communicate with anything external over an unknown distance right though whatever may be between? Could this ride on the "entanglement" idea?

"If he shows – if he is in his right mind. If only he is willing to entertain my questions. If he talks in a way a mere mortal can understand.

"Too many ifs.

"Luna is alone. There are strangers about – Fellfall is so isolated. I go once more tilting at windmills. Talking to myself, mostly.

"At least if Dirac talks likely no one will take him seriously.

A Pause

They met on a moorland. The rolling ground was as black as night and the sky was dressed in full stars. The stars were tiny bubbles and whorls. Distant molecular fireflies. There was a difference between the black of the ground and that of the sky. The ground pulled them down. The sky pulled their eyes. They walked in between until they met.

Their faces weren't visible. They didn't wear shawls or hoods. It wasn't scary or weird. They were just shadowed. The light was dim. Yet, they could feel each other's presence. A feeling of warmth. Beats, pulses, signals, bells. It was enough, at that time, in that place.

# MARK

They oriented towards each other while continuing to gaze at the sky. It resolved, formed, drifted, and dissolved. It was at once stately and dynamic. Each wondered if the other was seeing the same lights and motions. Each wondered if it was the same sky.

# METADATA

Eventually, they concluded it was time to speak. As with supermarket and airport meetings, conferences on Monday mornings, and anytime in bars, there were rote topics and patterns.

"Hello. How are you?

What did that even mean in that place?

"How long have you been here?

Not an easy question to answer, actually. As it was rhetorical, precision was not needed.

"How was your journey? Did you get some sleep on the way?

As they lackadaisically worked through the questions, their shadowed eyes darted and zoomed.

"Do you have any plans for the future?

They were nearing the end of the conversational guy wires. The pauses were growing longer.

"Hey, where do we know each other from?

It was a good question. The answer was noncommittal. It was hard to say.

"The view is amazing. What part are you looking at?

The taller one was stiller. The smaller one moved slightly against the sky.

"We have something in common, you know.

The taller one moved just a hair, turning towards the other.

"We are both here.

The smaller one moved fractionally closer.

"Yes, both here.
